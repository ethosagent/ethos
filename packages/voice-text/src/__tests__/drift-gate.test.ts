// Voice V1a drift gate (eng-review D8) — one implementation, enforced.
//
// The speakable-text logic had drifted into three near-identical copies (the
// gateway, voice-session, and web-api each carried a hallucination filter, and
// three surfaces each carried their own sentence splitter). Reviews did not
// catch it; a copy is cheap to write and invisible in a diff. So the invariant
// is a test, not a convention.
//
// The scan is textual on purpose: it fails on the DECLARATION, which is what a
// second copy looks like when it appears. Importing from @ethosagent/voice-text
// is always fine — that is the point.
//
// If you genuinely need a differently-shaped implementation, the answer is an
// option on the shared function, not a second definition.

// moved down there when `LaneVoiceModeStore` (packages/core) had to persist the
// mode — core depends on contracts only, so the shared value type could not stay
// here. Widening this map to anything that is not the contracts package
// re-opens the drift this gate exists to prevent.
