// Production wiring for the two danger-predicate seams.
//
// `createDangerPredicate` accepts `getPersonality` (which personality's
// approval policy applies to this call) and `smartApprove` (the LLM reviewer
// behind `approvalMode: 'smart'`). Every entry point used to call it with
// NEITHER, so the mode dispatch always resolved to `manual` and
// `safety.denyRules` was never consulted — the config was inert. This module
// builds both seams out of what an entry point already has: the hook
// registries of the loops it owns, and the personality registry those loops
// resolve against.
//
// Cost posture: nothing here runs on the common path. The `session_start`
// handler is a single Map write per turn; the reviewer and its provider are
// constructed only when a flagged call actually reaches `approvalMode: smart`.
