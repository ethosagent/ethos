// The far-end `agent_consult` — the ONE tool a phone caller's realtime session
// may call back into the agent with (voice V4 E6, eng-review D12/D13).
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FACTORY, AND NOT A PARAMETER ON THE OWNER'S ONE.
// `build-agent-loop.ts` registers a consult tool pinned to
// `{ transport: 'browser-talk-mode', speaker: 'owner' }`, because the browser is
// the only surface in this repo that can open a realtime session behind the
// operator's own session cookie. A phone call is the opposite: whoever is on the
// other end is a stranger, and the spoken-confirmation gate refuses their
// requests BEFORE it consults any recorded confirmation
// (`./spoken-confirmation`). That refusal keys on exactly one field —
// `voiceOrigin.speaker` — so a call path that reused the owner's instance would
// silently promote every caller to the operator. Making it a distinct exported
// factory is what stops that from being a thing an app layer can forget.
//
// WHAT MAKES THE RECEPTIONIST SCOPE RESTRICTED. Nothing new. A turn's memory
// scope is `personality:<id>` and its tool allowlist is that personality's
// `toolset` — both derived from the personality in
// `packages/core/.../stages/turn-setup.ts`. Pinning the consulted turn to
// `voice.inbound.receptionist` therefore denies owner memory and privileged
// tools by construction: its scope is `personality:<receptionist>`, and a tool
// it does not list is rejected by `ToolRegistry.executeParallel` exactly as any
// other disallowed tool is. There is no second restriction system to keep in
// step with the first.
