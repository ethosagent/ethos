// Production construction of the real-time voice stack.
//
// Before this module, `VoiceSession`, `VoiceChannelAdapter`, the LiveKit/SIP
// transports and `config.voice.*` were all built, typed and unit-tested — and
// had zero construction sites. This is the wiring that makes them reachable.
//
// Two rules shape it:
//
//   1. Absent config is a clean no-op, never a crash. No `voice.*` block AND
//      no `auxiliary.asr`/`auxiliary.tts` → `buildVoiceStack` returns null and
//      nothing downstream changes. A deployment that configures ONLY
//      `auxiliary.asr`/`auxiliary.tts` (the shape `docs/using/how-to/local-voice.md`
//      documents — local Whisper/Kokoro, no `voice.*` block at all) still gets
//      a stack: a minimal `voice = { bots: [] }` is synthesized so the browser
//      pipeline lane's `VoiceSession` can be built from the auxiliary
//      providers, the same fallback `resolveSttFor`/`resolveTtsFor` already
//      apply when a roster entry names nothing. Telephony (`voice.livekit`,
//      `voice.trunk`, `voice.bots`) stays unavailable in that shape, honestly —
//      there is nothing configured for it to answer with. The LiveKit/SIP
//      MEDIA leg additionally requires an app-supplied room-client binding
//      (`@livekit/rtc-node` is not a repo dependency), so a half-configured
//      deployment degrades to "that transport is unavailable" rather than
//      throwing at boot.
//
//      What is NO LONGER app-supplied: the LiveKit token minter and the SIP
//      CONTROL plane. Both are plain signed-JWT + HTTPS work that
//      `@ethosagent/platform-voice` implements without an SDK, and both are
//      built here from `voice.livekit.*` / `voice.trunk.*`. Before this,
//      `voice.livekit.apiKey`/`apiSecret` were parsed and never read and
//      `VoiceStack.sipTrunk` was `undefined` in every shipped deployment —
//      which is to say telephony was configured and unreachable.
//
//   2. Providers resolve through ONE path — `resolveSttProviderForPersonality` /
//      `resolveTtsProviderForPersonality` in `@ethosagent/core`, shared with the
//      gateway and web-api — so the provider id stamped into the latency spans
//      is the provider that actually ran, and the local-only egress gate cannot
//      be bypassed by constructing a provider some other way. Resolution is
//      per-PERSONALITY and memoized per roster entry, not per deployment: the
//      personality that speaks picks the provider, and two personalities naming
//      different roster entries get different providers on the same machine.
