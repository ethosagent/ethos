// What goes into a backup, and which named scope carries it (plan D1).
//
// Three scopes:
//   identity   config.yaml, mcp.json, MEMORY.md, USER.md, cron/jobs.json,
//              personalities/ — who this agent is. Small, restorable live.
//   state      every database that is not telemetry or transient, plus
//              skills/, teams/, users/, digests/, cron/output/, a2a/, the
//              channel digest's cursor file and the plugin pins. Large, and
//              holds conversation history — an archive containing it is as
//              sensitive as the machine it came from.
//   telemetry  observability.db. Opt-in; nothing depends on it.
//
// Classification is an ALLOWLIST. A path that matches no rule is not archived.
// That direction is deliberate: `~/.ethos/` accumulates directories faster
// than this table does, and the failure mode of forgetting one is a missing
// file, not a leaked secret.
//
// Databases are the exception to "silence is fine": every `journal_mode = WAL`
// call site in the repo is registered in `WAL_STORES` below, and
// `scopes.test.ts` fails if the repo grows one that is not. See that test for
// what to do when it fires.
//
// NON-DATABASE STATE HAS NO SUCH GATE, and adding one was considered and
// rejected. A database is enumerable from the repo — a `journal_mode = WAL`
// pragma is a grep, and a module maps to exactly one path — so `WAL_STORES` can
// be a manifest that CI compares against. A JSON state file has no equivalent
// marker: the paths are joined from `dataDir` at wiring time, most `writeAtomic`
// call sites write somewhere other than `~/.ethos/`, and a gate over "every file
// in a live `~/.ethos/`" would fire on scratch files, editor droppings and
// anything an operator left there. That is a gate that gets muted, and a muted
// gate is worse than the allowlist it replaces. The rule stays: a new file under
// `~/.ethos/` that must survive a restore needs a line in `RULES` below and a
// test that pins it, the way `channel-digest-watermarks.json` now has both.
//
// Raw `node:fs` here is the documented Storage carve-out (AGENTS.md): the walk
// needs `readdirSync` with dirents to refuse symlinks, and `statSync` for the
// byte size a ustar header must declare.
