// Who holds a backup lock, and is that holder still there?
//
// Three files in this package guard a directory with an advisory `wx` sentinel —
// `backup/restore.ts`'s `.restore-in-progress`, `backup-schedule.ts`'s
// `backups/.lock` and `identity-map.ts`'s `users/identity-map.json.lock` — and
// all have to answer the same question about the body they find: is the process
// that wrote this still running?
//
// `process.kill(pid, 0)` answers a WEAKER question: "is SOME process wearing
// this number". After a reboot the OS hands low pids out again, so a dead
// holder's pid can read as alive for ever and the lock becomes immortal.
//
// That used to be capped with a wall clock — past 24h (restore) or 36h (backup)
// a holder was declared dead whatever its pid said. That is the wrong shape:
// the two failure modes are not symmetric. A lock nobody can take is LOUD and
// an operator can clear it by hand. Taking over a holder that is genuinely
// alive is SILENT: two writers streaming the same databases, or a recovery pass
// rolling back renames another restore is still making. A wall-clock guess
// about "too long" is eventually false, and when it is false it fails the
// expensive way.
//
// So: identity, not time. Record WHICH BOOT the pid belongs to alongside it. A
// holder from a different boot cannot be the process wearing that pid now, so it
// is unconditionally stale. Within one boot, pid reuse is far rarer and is left
// to the operator — which is why both refusals name the pid and say what to
// check before clearing the file.
//
// The identity has to be EXACT, or the same asymmetry bites again from the other
// side: a boot id derived from the wall clock disagrees with itself across a
// clock correction, and two processes from one boot then read each other as
// different boots. Only Linux can supply an exact one, so only Linux gets an
// automatic takeover; everywhere else this returns null and the answer is
// refusal. Degradation is always toward refusal, on every platform.
//
// A THIRD sentinel asks the same question from below the layer model:
// `extensions/gateway/src/channel-digest-lock.ts`, the ambient channel digest's
// run lock. `extensions/` cannot import `packages/wiring` (ARCHITECTURE.md §II),
// so `currentBootId` and `classifyHolder` are COPIED there — the same
// duplication, for the same reason, as the symlink guard carried twice by
// `packages/core/src/scoped/scoped-fs.ts` and
// `packages/storage-fs/src/scoped-storage.ts`. THE TWO MUST CHANGE TOGETHER;
// that file carries the pointer back to this one.
//
// Raw `node:fs` here is the documented Storage carve-out (AGENTS.md): the Linux
// boot id is a system path under `/proc`, not `~/.ethos/` state.

/**
 * An identifier for the current boot, or `null` where this platform has no way
 * to give one that can be trusted.
 *
 * ONLY AN EXACT IDENTIFIER COUNTS. An approximation cannot be made safe by
 * widening the tolerance around it: a boot id is used to declare a holder dead
 * and take its lock, so being wrong once is a silent concurrent writer, and
 * that is worse than every lock this could have cleared automatically.
 *
 * - **Linux** — `/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id`, a UUID the kernel generates
 *   at boot. Exact: it is not derived from any clock, so nothing an operator or
 *   an NTP daemon does can move it.
 * - **macOS** — `null`. There is no exact boot identifier here. `Date.now()/1000
 *   - os.uptime()` is a WALL-CLOCK derivation, so a manual correction or a large
 *   NTP step makes two processes from the SAME boot compute different values and
 *   one of them preempts a demonstrably live holder — exactly the corruption
 *   this module exists to prevent, reintroduced by the mechanism meant to remove
 *   it. Reading `kern.boottime` through `sysctl` does not fix that: XNU ADJUSTS
 *   `kern.boottime` whenever the calendar clock is set, so it is the same
 *   wall-clock quantity with a subprocess in front of it — a subprocess spawned
 *   inside a lock-acquisition path, at that. A wrong answer here is worse than
 *   no answer, so this gives no answer.
 * - **Windows and anything else** — `null`. `uv_uptime` there comes from
 *   `GetTickCount64`, which excludes time spent asleep, so a laptop that slept
 *   for an hour reports a boot an hour later than the one it actually had.
 *
 * `null` means "cannot prove a different boot", and the callers then never take
 * a live pid over. The cost, on every platform but Linux: after a reboot
 * recycles the pid a holder recorded, the lock reads as live for ever and an
 * operator has to delete it by hand. Both refusals — `restoreInProgress` in
 * `backup/restore.ts` and the timeout in `acquireBackupLock` — already name the
 * pid, say to check it with `ps -p`, and say what deleting the file costs if it
 * is not really gone. That is the same operator-recovery path a recycled pid
 * needs, so this degradation lands on a road that already exists.
 *
 * Memoised: a process cannot outlive the boot it started in, so this is
 * constant for the life of the process, and it is read on a lock path that can
 * spin.
