// Build an archive: enumerate, snapshot, stream, manifest last.
//
// Ordering matters and is not negotiable. Every per-file sha256 is computed
// while the bytes stream past, so the manifest cannot be written until the
// last file has been. `restore.ts` relies on that: it reads the manifest in a
// full pre-pass and trusts nothing until every hash matches.
//
// Databases never enter the archive as live files. Each is snapshotted into a
// staging directory first (D2), because a WAL database's committed data is
// split between the main file and an uncheckpointed `-wal` — streaming the
// main file alone silently drops everything since the last checkpoint.
//
// The archive is written to a temporary file and renamed onto `outPath` only
// once it is complete. Opening `outPath` directly would truncate whatever is
// already there before the first byte of the replacement exists, so a snapshot,
// stream, gzip or disk failure part-way through would destroy the previous good
// backup — the one thing a failed backup must never do, and the exact case
// rotation (`backup.keep`) walks into by pointing run after run at one
// directory.
//
// Raw `node:fs` here is the documented Storage carve-out (AGENTS.md).
