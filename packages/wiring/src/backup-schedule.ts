// The scheduled half of `ethos backup` — what the `backup` system cron job
// runs, and the settings that drive it.
//
// Three things separate a scheduled backup from the CLI one:
//
//  1. It runs INSIDE a serving process, so the snapshot mode is `'backup'`
//     (async, plan D2). `VACUUM INTO` is synchronous in `@ethosagent/sqlite`
//     and would stall the event loop — every gateway turn, every HTTP request,
//     every voice frame — for as long as it takes to copy the databases.
//  2. It rotates. Run after run it points at one directory, so without a limit
//     it fills the disk it is protecting.
//  3. It shares that directory with a human who may run `ethos backup` at the
//     same moment, hence the `.lock` sentinel.
//
// Rotation deletes files, so it is deliberately narrow about which ones it
// will consider: only entries matching the exact name this module writes
// (`SCHEDULED_ARCHIVE_RE`). A `*.tar.gz` glob would sweep up a manual
// `ethos backup` archive, a pre-upgrade copy an operator parked here, or an
// unrelated tarball — the way a backup tool ends up eating something it did
// not create.

/**
 * Exclusive-create sentinel, the agent-mesh `wx` idiom
 * (`extensions/agent-mesh/src/index.ts`): a manual `ethos backup` and the
 * scheduled job must not stream the same databases into two archives at once.
 *
 * Raw `node:fs` on purpose. An atomic create-if-absent has no equivalent in the
 * `Storage` contract — `exists()` then `write()` is the race this exists to
 * close — the same carve-out `acquireRegistryLock` and `acquirePidFile` carry.
 * Everything else this module touches goes through `Storage`.
 *
 * The lock is OWNED, not just present: its body carries a `token` unique to the
 * acquiring call. Exactly ONE step below is atomic, and it is the only one that
 * decides anything — the `wx` create. Whoever's create returns without EEXIST
 * won; every read, compare and unlink around it is confirmation, never
 * arbitration. The protocol:
 *
 *  1. `wx` create. Succeeding means we MAY hold the lock.
 *  2. Re-read, and confirm the file still carries OUR bytes. A contender that
 *     had already classified the lock we displaced as stale can unlink ours and
 *     install its own in the gap after step 1. If it did, we do not hold the
 *     lock — so we abandon the attempt and go back to waiting rather than hand
 *     the caller a release closure for someone else's file. This is what makes
 *     "two contenders both took over the same abandoned lock" settle on one
 *     holder instead of two.
 *  3. On EEXIST, classify the incumbent. Stale (pid gone, a holder from another
 *     boot, or unreadable and past the stale window) means re-read and unlink
 *     only if the bytes are still the ones we judged. That comparison makes the losing contender
 *     decline in the common case; it is NOT the guarantee. Step 2 is.
 *
 * What this does NOT do, plainly. POSIX has no atomic compare-and-delete for a
 * pathname: `unlink` names a path, not the inode that was read, so every
 * check-then-unlink here — the takeover's and `release`'s alike — leaves a
 * window in which the file can be replaced between the compare and the unlink,
 * and the unlink then removes a successor's live lock. Step 2 answers that
 * without curing it: a contender notices the loss only if its confirmation read
 * lands after the unlink that took its lock away. Should it land before, two
 * processes both believe they hold the lock and stream the same databases into
 * the same directory at once. Both windows are a few microseconds of adjacent
 * synchronous syscalls, reachable only when two contenders classify the SAME
 * abandoned lock as stale inside that span. Narrowed and stated, not closed.
 *
 * Comparing the open descriptor's inode against a `stat` of the path just
 * before unlinking was considered and rejected: it relocates the window rather
 * than closing it, and buys nothing the `token` does not already buy — a
 * successor's body is never byte-equal to the one we read.
 *
 * `release` keeps the same comparison, for the same reason and with the same
 * residual: a holder that overran the stale window and was legitimately taken
 * over must not delete its successor's lock on the way out. Step 2 cannot help
 * there — by then the backup has already run and there is nothing left to
 * retry — so declining to unlink bytes that are not ours is the whole of what
 * release can do, and it does that much.
 *
 * The token is what makes every byte comparison sound: `pid` + `startedAt`
 * alone repeat if one process re-acquires within the same millisecond.
