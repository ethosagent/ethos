/**
 * Create the write directories a personality's `fs_reach` derives, if they
 * don't exist yet. Posture-independent on purpose — a missing write dir breaks
 * BOTH execution postures, for different reasons:
 *
 * - docker: `mountsFor` never creates the host path, so Docker auto-creates the
 *   missing bind source as ROOT. The container runs `--user <host uid>:<gid>`,
 *   so the non-root process gets EACCES on its own write dir. This bites the
 *   built-in personalities hardest — their `~/.ethos/personalities/<id>/` may
 *   not exist on the host at all.
 * - local: `Storage.write()` requires the parent directory to already exist.
 *
 * A declared `fs_reach.workdir` is part of the derived write set, so it is
 * pre-created here too — the personality's working directory exists before its
 * first relative write.
 *
 * When a write path is `ownDir` or an ancestor of it, `ownDir/files` is
 * created as well: `DockerExecutionBackend.mountsFor` mounts `ownDir`
 * read-only with a rw `ownDir/files` child in exactly that case, and a missing
 * bind source would be auto-created by Docker as ROOT (see above).
 *
 * Read-only reach is NOT created: a read prefix that doesn't exist is simply an
 * empty scope, and materializing it would grant the personality a directory it
 * never asked to own.
 *
 * Idempotent (existing paths are skipped), directories only, and never touches
 * the docker backend's `FORBIDDEN_MOUNT_ROOTS` denylist — the same predicate,
 * imported, not a second copy. A path that cannot be created is a warning, not
 * a crash: one unavailable path must not take down the whole compose.
