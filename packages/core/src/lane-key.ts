// The one encoder for lane / session keys.
//
// A lane key names a CONVERSATION. Two conversations that share a key share a
// history, a queue and a turn — which is the failure behind OpenClaw #112253,
// where a phone call and a desktop session interleaved into one session. So the
// rule here is not "make collisions unlikely", it is "make them unconstructible":
// every segment is URL-encoded, so a segment carrying the `:` separator cannot
// alias two distinct keys onto one string.
//
// Continuity with pre-encoding session keys is only guaranteed for segments
// that are themselves URL-safe: platform identifiers (`telegram` / `slack` /
// ...), the hex-derived default botKey (`deriveBotKey` in `./bot-key`), numeric
// Slack `thread_ts`, and the chat IDs the supported platforms emit. An operator
// who configures a custom `id:` value containing reserved characters will see
// their existing SQLite session key change shape once after upgrade and their
// history orphan — that's the cost of choosing an unusual botKey, not a
// regression in the common case.
//
// Treat the returned string as opaque everywhere except `laneKeyBotKey` below:
// collisions only matter at construction time, and this file is the single
// point of truth for what a lane key looks like — including how to read the one
// segment callers legitimately need back out of it.
