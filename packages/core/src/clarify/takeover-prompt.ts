// clarify is not a question, and a channel cannot answer it: the browser being
// handed over is open on the machine running Ethos, and the hand-back button
// lives in the web chat. So Telegram / Slack / Discord / WhatsApp render one
// sentence that says where the agent is stuck and where to go, instead of a
// prompt that looks answerable in the chat it arrived in.
//
// One function rather than four copies of the same sentence: the wording is a
// contract with the user, and four surfaces drifting apart on it is exactly the
// kind of divergence that makes a takeover unrecoverable on the third channel.
