// ClarifyBridge — the runtime mechanism behind the `clarify` tool.
//
// The `clarify` tool calls `request()`, which persists a pending row, presents
// it to the active surface, and returns a promise that resolves when the user
// answers (`respond()`), the timeout fires, or the turn is aborted. A surface
// (TUI / CLI / web-api) registers a `presenter` for its own surface type and
// calls `respond()` when the user replies. This mirrors the tool-call approval
// transport — the agent is paused by the blocked tool, not by interleaving
// events into the stream.
//
// See plan/phases/tool_clarity_plan.md and plan/phases/pi-delegation.md §5/§6
// Phase 1 (G1/G2/G3, D2/D7/D22).

   * earlier is ordinary, not an error — but they no longer look like success:
   * every path returns a `ClarifyRespondOutcome` (`./respond-outcome`), and a
   * caller claiming a hand-back has to read `resolved`. Four branches below are
   * distinguishable failures and each names itself: no row anywhere
   * (`unknown_request`), the answer gate refusing the row's surface
   * (`not_answerable`, twice — once per branch), and an answer already on the
   * row discarding this one (`already_answered`).
   *
   * That last one is why the outcome could not be inferred from outside:
   * `notifyResolved` fires on the discard path too, with the caller's own
   * response object, so web-api's identity test read a thrown-away answer as a
   * hand-back. The notification payload is deliberately unchanged here — which
   * response a listener should be shown when two answers race is a separate
   * question from what this call returns to its caller.
   *
   * Fix 2 (pi-delegation.md §1b) — no in-process entry means one of TWO
   * things, and this bridge cannot tell which: the owning process crashed
   * (this respond() call is the final word), or the owning process is alive
   * in a DIFFERENT process sharing this store (gateway vs web-api are always
   * separate OS processes) and will find the answer itself via its own
   * `pollForAnswers()`. So: persist the answer onto the row (`store.update`,
   * never `store.remove`) instead of discarding it — that is what makes the
   * live-elsewhere case actually deliver. `notifyResolved` still fires on
   * THIS bridge immediately either way: harmless when this bridge has no
   * listeners for the row's surface (the common cross-process case, e.g.
   * web-api answering a Telegram-origin row), and exactly what's needed for
   * a same-process-restart answer (there is no other process left to do it).
   *
   * LIMITATION — the "first writer wins" this branch aims for is a NARROWING,
   * not a guarantee, and nothing enforces it. `store.get` and `store.update`
   * below are two separate awaits, so the guard is check-then-act: the window
   * is every instant between the read returning and the write landing, and two
   * `respond()` calls inside it — in this process, or in any other sharing the
   * store — both see `answer === undefined`, both write, and BOTH return
   * `{ resolved: true }`, while the row keeps only the later answer. One of
   * those callers is then told exactly the thing `ClarifyRespondOutcome`
   * (`./respond-outcome`) was introduced to stop it saying.
   *
   * There is no compare-and-set to reach for. `ClarifyStore`
   * (`packages/types/src/clarify.ts`) has none, and `FileClarifyStore`
   * (`./file-clarify-store`) could not honour one across processes if it did:
   * its `mutate` mutex is per-process, and `Storage.writeAtomic` rewrites the
   * whole of `pending.json` from a snapshot read before it — untorn, not
   * isolated, so two processes racing already lose each other's writes on
   * every field, not just this one. Closing the window needs cross-process
   * isolation the store does not have (an atomic create-if-absent lock, or a
   * SQLite-backed store): a change to make deliberately, not a comment to
   * write.
   *
   * What the guard DOES buy, and all it buys: an answer that had already
   * landed BEFORE this call started is never overwritten, and its would-be
   * overwriter is told `already_answered` rather than `resolved`. That is the
   * ordinary case — a question answered in another tab a moment earlier — and
   * `packages/core/src/__tests__/clarify-respond-outcome.test.ts` ("reports
   * already_answered for an answer first-writer-wins DISCARDS") pins it. The
   * millisecond race has no pinning test because it has no enforcer to pin.

   *
   * LIMITATION — this does not check who is ANSWERING, because it cannot.
   * `ClarifyResponse` (`packages/types/src/clarify.ts`) carries `requestId`,
   * `answer` and `source` and no surface, so by the time an answer reaches this
   * funnel the responder's identity is gone. "Only a surface that can reach
   * that browser answers a takeover" is therefore NOT a funnel guarantee; it is
   * an invariant each adapter carries by refusing rows that are not its own
   * before it responds, and it holds today only because all four channel
   * adapters do:
   *
   *   `extensions/platform-telegram/src/clarify-surface.ts` — `handleCallback`
   *     (`row.surfaceType !== SURFACE`) and `correlateMessage`
   *     (`store.list({ surfaceType: SURFACE })`).
   *   `extensions/platform-slack/src/clarify-surface.ts` — `handleAction` and
   *     `handleModalSubmit` (both `row.surfaceType !== SURFACE`).
   *   `extensions/platform-discord/src/clarify-surface.ts` — the modal-submit
   *     and button-click paths (both `row.surfaceType !== SURFACE`).
   *   `extensions/platform-whatsapp/src/clarify-surface.ts` —
   *     `correlateMessage` (`store.list({ surfaceType: SURFACE })`).
   *
   * A fifth adapter that responded to a row it did not present would hand back
   * a `web` takeover from a group chat and this gate would allow it, because
   * the row says `web`. Closing that properly means a responder surface on
   * `ClarifyResponse` — a frozen-schema change (ARCHITECTURE.md §VII) with its
   * own decision to make — so it is written down here rather than half-done.
   *
   * Here rather than in each adapter because here is the ONE funnel: every
   * surface, in every process (a channel's own `respond()`, the cross-process
   * `answer` a peer bridge wrote onto the row and this one reconciles, the web
   * takeover socket's hand-back) arrives at this method. Three adapters each
   * grew their own free-form answer path and each looked correct alone; a
   * fifth cannot repeat that, because refusal is what happens when nobody
   * writes any code at all.
   *
   * Scoped to `source === 'user'`: `cancel` and both `timeout-*` sources pass
   * through untouched, so a takeover nobody may answer still resolves and
   * `browser_request_takeover`'s `finally` still clears the session lock.
   *
   * Throws nothing, like every other unresolvable `respond()` — but no longer
   * silent: a refusal here becomes `{ resolved: false, reason:
   * 'not_answerable' }`, which is the one unresolved reason that leaves the row
   * fully OPEN. The surfaces below refuse to draw an answer affordance for a
   * takeover in the first place, so a user is rarely waiting on the reply; the
   * web fallback path (`clarify.respond`) draws no such affordance either and

   *   - Rows already adopted — by an earlier `hydrate()` or by a live
