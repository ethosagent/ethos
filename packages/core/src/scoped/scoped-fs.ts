// `extensions/gateway/src/media.ts`. Do not "fix" this back to Storage.
// Sync (`lstatSync`, not `fs/promises`) because `checkReach` is synchronous

 * Scoped filesystem capability. Enforces three layers on every call:
 *
 *  1. **Non-overridable deny floor** — `alwaysDenyPaths` (injected at
 *     construction) lists `.ssh`, `.aws/credentials`, `/etc/passwd`,
 *     `/root`, etc. A path that touches any of these denies even when
 *     the capability and personality both grant the parent (mirror of
 *     `safety-network`'s cloud-metadata block).
 *
 *  1b. **Write-only deny list** — `writeDenyPaths` (injected at
 *     construction, fifth argument) refuses WRITES to the personality's own
 *     definition files (`personalityWriteDeny` in `../fs-reach.ts`) even
 *     when the write reach covers them. Reads are unaffected. Mirror of
 *     `ScopedStorageScope.writeDeny` in
 *     `packages/storage-fs/src/scoped-storage.ts` — the two MUST change
 *     together.
 *
 *  2. **Declared reach allowlist** — the intersection of the tool's
 *     `capabilities.fs_reach` with the personality's `fs_reach`,
 *     resolved at registration time. Paths outside the allow set are
 *     rejected with `PATH_NOT_REACHABLE`.
 *
 *  3. **Symbolic containment** — layers 1 and 2 are lexical, and
 *     `normalize(resolve())` is a string operation while a symlink is a
 *     filesystem fact. A link planted inside an allowed prefix pointing
 *     outside it passes both. Layer 3 walks the path segment by segment
 *     below the matched prefix and follows any link it finds, re-judging
 *     layers 1 and 2 against where the link actually lands.
 *
 * This closes **misdirection**, not **TOCTOU**: an attacker who can swap a
 * path between this walk and the subsequent open still wins, and closing
 * that needs container-level remediation.
 *
 * The floor cannot be disabled by configuration. Tests that need to
 * exercise a forbidden path override `$HOME` before constructing the
 * wrapper.

// Layer 3 of `checkReach` above is a deliberate DUPLICATE of `ScopedStorage.check`

// code because `@ethosagent/core` may not import `@ethosagent/storage-fs` at
// runtime (storage-fs is the security kernel; core is not, and core depends on it
// only as a devDependency — ARCHITECTURE.md §II). A THIRD copy —
// `containedPath`/`followFirstSymlink` in `packages/wiring/src/backup/restore.ts` —
// guards the backup restore's destination paths under the Ethos data directory,
// duplicated for the same reason: `packages/wiring` is a different layer. A
// FOURTH lives in `reachable` in `apps/web-api/src/services/documents.service.ts`,
// guarding the operator-supplied Documents root.
// **All four must change together:** a fix applied to one boundary and not the
// others leaves the escape open on whichever path the caller happens to take.
// The reciprocal notes live in `scoped-storage.ts`'s class doc and in
// `restore.ts`'s `followFirstSymlink` doc.
//
// The fourth copy walks with async `lstat` from `node:fs/promises`, so an
// `lstatSync` grep does not find it. Its errno rule is the same as the other
// three: ENOENT alone ends the walk (here `lstatSync(..., { throwIfNoEntry:
// false })` returning `undefined`), and every other error — EACCES, ENOTDIR,
// the rest — refuses. Pinned for that copy by
// `apps/web-api/src/__tests__/services/documents.service.fail-closed.test.ts`.
// It differs in one deliberate way: it refuses ANY symlink rather than
// following it and re-judging the target.
