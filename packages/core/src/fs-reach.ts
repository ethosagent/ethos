 * This module is the SINGLE derivation both consume. When the two derivations
 * drift the failure is silent data loss: ScopedStorage permits a write to a
 * path the container never mounted, the container writes into its own ephemeral
 * layer, and `docker run --rm` discards it. One function, no copies.
 *
 * The derivation also yields the personality's WORKING DIRECTORY — the third
 * thing `fs_reach` decides. It lives here rather than in a sibling function
 * because the workdir *is* the `${CWD}` the read/write entries substitute
 * against; splitting them would reintroduce exactly the drift this module

/**
 * Derive a personality's effective working directory and read/write reach.

 * for the rest of the derivation — the workdir IS the personality's cwd, so
 * `${CWD}` in a read/write entry and the `cwd` entry in the defaults both mean
 * the workdir.
 *
 * `fs_reach.workdir` may declare MULTIPLE roots (`string[]`) for the Documents
 * surface (see `deriveDocumentsRoots` below) — but this function keeps its
 * existing single-root contract for the agent's own `${CWD}`/cwd purposes, so
 * only the FIRST declared entry is used here. Callers that need every declared
 * root (the Documents service) must call `deriveDocumentsRoots` instead.
 *
 * Declared `fs_reach.read` / `fs_reach.write` win when non-empty; each entry is
 * substituted. When a list is absent or empty the defaults apply:
 *
 *   read  = [ownDir, `${ethosHome}/skills/`, workdir]
 *   write = [ownDir, workdir]
 *
 * where `ownDir = ${ethosHome}/personalities/<self>/`. The defaults use the raw
 * variable values and never call `substitute`, so a personality that declares
 * nothing can never hit `EmptySubstitutionError`.
 *
 * A DECLARED workdir is additionally injected (deduped) into both lists: a
 * declared `write` REPLACES the defaults, so declaring both a workdir and a
 * write list would otherwise leave the workdir unwritable. The injection is
 * conditional on the workdir being declared — with no declaration the returned
 * lists are byte-for-byte what they were before `workdir` existed, so an
 * existing personality's reach is never silently widened to include the cwd.
 *
 * `writeDeny` is the personality's own DEFINITION — `personalityWriteDeny`
 * below. It is returned on every branch, declared or not: a declared
 * `fs_reach.write: ['${ETHOS_HOME}/']` covers `ownDir` and must not reopen it.
 * There is deliberately no knob to turn it off.
