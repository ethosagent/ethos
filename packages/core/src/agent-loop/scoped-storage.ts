/**
 * Decorate the base Storage with the turn's `fs_reach` scope.
 *
 * The scope arrives already derived — `deriveFsReachPaths` runs ONCE per turn,
 * in the turn-setup stage, and the same result yields both this allowlist and
 * `ToolContext.workingDir`. Re-deriving here would be worse than wasteful: a
 * personality declaring `fs_reach.workdir: ${CWD}/out` resolves `${CWD}` against
 * the *boot* cwd, so feeding the already-resolved workdir back in as `cwd` would
 * compound it into `.../out/out`. One derivation, one scope.
 *
 * `writeDeny` (the personality's definition files, `personalityWriteDeny` in
 * `fs-reach.ts`) is passed through unchanged; the factory enforces it.
 *
 * Returns undefined when no base Storage is wired, leaving
 * `ToolContext.storage` unset (legacy behaviour — tools fall back to raw fs).
