 * late auditor's promise stays pending forever, which is its own leak, but it
 * cannot reject unhandled — `allSettled` attached a handler to it at the start
 * and keeps it whether the race won or lost.
 *
 * `audit` is invoked INSIDE a `Promise.resolve().then(...)` rather than called
 * directly in the `map`. Fail-open would otherwise be a half-truth: a
 * `TurnAuditor` is an interface, so `audit` need not be `async`, and one that
 * throws SYNCHRONOUSLY — a plain method, a guard clause, a bad destructure —
 * throws while the array is still being built, before `allSettled` exists to
 * settle anything. The exception would escape `finalizeTurn`, and the turn
 * would end with no `done` event at all: the loop hangs on the very failure the
 * budget and the `allSettled` were written to absorb. Deferring the call turns
 * that throw into a rejection the existing handling already covers.

 * appended while the await was in flight survives.
 *
 * The write is best-effort. Three of the five early exits (abort, watcher

 * exist to emit, and a storage failure must not replace that event with a
 * thrown generator. Nothing is lost either way: the `messages`
 * rows are authoritative (analytics decision 9) and already persisted, so the
