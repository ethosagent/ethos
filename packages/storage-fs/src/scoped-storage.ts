/**
 * Decorator over Storage that enforces a per-scope read/write allowlist
 * plus the Ch.5 universal always-deny floor. Used by tools-file to bound
 * a personality's filesystem reach to its own directory + cwd.
 *
 * Order of checks (any deny wins over any allow):
 *   1. always-deny — request rejected.
 *   1b. write-deny — WRITES only: request rejected when the path is (or is
 *      under) a `writeDeny` entry. `remove` and `rename` additionally refuse
 *      a path that CONTAINS a `writeDeny` entry, because deleting or moving a
 *      directory rewrites everything below it.
 *   2. allow allowlist — request rejected if no prefix matches.
 *   3. symbolic containment — layers 1 and 2 are lexical, and `resolve()`
 *      is a string operation while a symlink is a filesystem fact. A link
 *      planted inside an allowed prefix pointing outside it passes both.
 *      Layer 3 walks the path segment by segment BELOW the matched prefix
 *      and follows any link it finds, re-judging layers 1, 1b and 2 against
 *      where the link actually lands (G11).
 *
 * This closes **misdirection**, not **TOCTOU**: an attacker who can swap a
 * path between this walk and the subsequent open still wins, and closing
 * that needs container-level remediation.
 *
 * Layer 3 is a deliberate DUPLICATE of `checkReach` in
 * `packages/core/src/scoped/scoped-fs.ts` — the same guarantee enforced at
 * the other personality filesystem boundary. It is not shared code because
 * `@ethosagent/core` may not import `@ethosagent/storage-fs` at runtime
 * (storage-fs is the security kernel; core is not, and core depends on it
 * only as a devDependency). A THIRD copy —
 * `containedPath`/`followFirstSymlink` in
 * `packages/wiring/src/backup/restore.ts` — guards the backup restore's
 * destination paths under the Ethos data directory, duplicated for the same
 * reason: `packages/wiring` is a different layer. A FOURTH is `reachable` in
 * `apps/web-api/src/services/documents.service.ts`, guarding the
 * operator-supplied Documents root. **All four must change together.**
 * Layer 1b (`writeDeny`) exists in exactly two of them — this file and
 * `ScopedFsImpl.checkReach` (`writeDenyPaths`) — the two boundaries a
 * personality's turn writes through; those two must change together too.
 *
 * The fourth is NOT equivalent today. It walks with async `lstat` from
 * `node:fs/promises` — so an `lstatSync` grep misses it — and swallows every
 * stat error with `.catch(() => null)`, then CONTINUES the walk, where the
 * other three abort on anything but ENOENT. That is the fail-open commit
 * 69e7b26d removed from `restore.ts`; bringing it into line is a pending fix.
 *
 * Prefixes are matched literally — there is no glob expansion. Pass paths
 * that end in `/` for directory scopes; ScopedStorage normalizes them so
 * `/a/b` does not also match `/a/bc/`.
