/**
 * Canonical set of security-sensitive filesystem paths — credentials,
 * private keys, shell histories, and system auth/kernel interfaces that no
 * personality or tool may read or write.
 *
 * Single source of truth for the filesystem deny mechanisms that would
 * otherwise drift independently:
 *   - ScopedStorage always-deny floor → `defaultAlwaysDeny()` (read + write)
 *   - tools-file write blocklist      → `BLOCKED_WRITE_*` (write only)
 *   - tools-terminal / tools-process  → `ARGV_FS_DENY_PATTERNS` (shell-argv match)
 *
 * Each entry is a path prefix: a directory deny (e.g. `~/.ssh`) also covers
 * everything beneath it. Recomputes `homedir()` per call so a test that
 * overrides `$HOME` before constructing a consumer sees the override rather
 * than a snapshotted directory.
 *
 * Coverage differs by mechanism, and that difference is intentional: the
 * always-deny and write floors cover this set in full, but the argv floor is
 * pattern-based and can only match a subset of these paths inside an
 * arbitrary shell string, so it references a subset. The parity tests in the
 * four consumers assert each one covers the manifest to the extent its
 * mechanism can, and never denies a path this manifest does not list.
