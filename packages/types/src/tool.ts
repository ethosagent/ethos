/**
 * Phase 2 (web-search-provider-selection) — optional per-personality tool

 * writes the resulting binding to the personality's `tools.yaml` (custom
 * personality) or the global `toolSettings` fallback (read-only built-in).
 *
 * Deliberately minimal — exactly THREE field kinds:
 *   • `enum`           — a fixed choice (e.g. the web_search provider).
 *   • `secret-binding` — a reference to a global NAMED secret. The binding
 *                        stores the secret NAME only; the value stays in the
 *                        vault and never travels to a personality directory or

 *                        category (e.g. an LLM key).
 *   • `info`           — a static disclosure. No key, no control, no value:
 *                        it exists so a tool that needs a credential it does
 *                        NOT bind itself can still say so where an operator
 *                        looks for credentials.
