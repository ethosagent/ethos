/**
 * The row identities of the published guarantee register

 * WHY HERE. The register's *prose* lives in the doc and its *citations* live in
 * `.architecture-state.yaml` (`register_anchors`), which the architecture
 * validator already ties to the doc in both directions. Neither is importable
 * by code, so a surface that reports per-personality register status — the
 * character sheet — needs the identities in TypeScript. `@ethosagent/types` is
 * the only package every layer may import, and the register is a contract about
 * the boundary, which is what this package holds.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A SECOND COPY. This list carries identities ONLY — no claims,
 * no enforcement points, no prose. `guarantee-register-ids.test.ts` asserts it
 * equals the `register_anchors` keys in `.architecture-state.yaml`, so
 * doc ↔ sidecar ↔ code is one validated chain rather than three lists that
 * agree today. Adding or withdrawing a guarantee fails that test until this
 * list is updated in the same commit — the same discipline as
 * `.personality-field-count`.
