// Phase 30.8 — this schema is FROZEN.
//
// Adding a top-level field to `PersonalityConfig` requires:
//   1. A CHANGELOG entry justifying why it isn't a skill, a tool, or a memory section.
//   2. The `personality-schema-change` label on the PR.
//   3. Two-maintainer approval (enforced via branch protection).
//   4. Bumping the count in `.personality-field-count` at the repo root.
//
// The mechanical CI gate lives in
// `packages/types/src/__tests__/personality-field-count.test.ts`. It parses
// this interface at test time and fails if the count drifts from
// `.personality-field-count`. Culture sets the rule; CI enforces it.
//
// Common rejections — these belong in skills or per-channel adapter config,
// NOT here:
//   - voice modes / TTS settings
//   - emotion / mood / sentiment tags
//   - label or response templates
//   - per-channel UI affordances
