   *                             runs for this personality.
   *   `judge.enabled`         — run the Personality Judge step. Default true.

   *
   *   - `remote` — this personality's work belongs on a machine that is NOT
   *     the one Ethos runs on. An agent whose hands only ever reach a build
   *     box is a different agent from one holding a shell here; every
   *     deployment of it agrees about that.
   *   - `none` — this personality does not execute. The refusal IS the
   *     identity: an agent with no hands.
   *
   * A personality NEVER names a transport. `docker` vs `local` vs `ssh` is a
   * machine fact two deployments of the same personality reasonably disagree
   * about — one runs inside a container, one has no daemon, one has an ssh
   * target — so it is the operator's, and the resolver already derives it from
   * environment, `~/.ethos/config.yaml` and the constitution. The earlier
   * four-literal form of this field (`local` / `docker` / `ssh` / `none`)
   * failed that test on its `local` and `docker` halves and named the ssh
   * transport on its third; those three literals are now load errors that
   * name the replacement.
   *
   * This is emphatically NOT the remote HOST. The target — host, user, port,
   * identity file, known-hosts, remote workdir — is operator config
   * (`execution.ssh.*` in `~/.ethos/config.yaml`), one per deployment. Never
   * put a hostname, user, or key path here.
   *
   * Absent = no requirement; the resolver picks the transport on its own
   * (sandboxed by default, the host when Ethos is itself containerized).
   * A requirement the deployment CANNOT satisfy is refused outright, never
   * silently downgraded: `remote` with no configured target leaves execution
   * tools unavailable rather than quietly running them on this machine.
   * Counts as ONE field for the schema-freeze gate.
