// @ethosagent/types — Storage interface
//
// Abstraction over filesystem operations under ~/.ethos/. Every consumer
// that reads or writes Ethos state takes a Storage in its constructor.
// Production wires FsStorage; tests wire InMemoryStorage; ScopedStorage
// decorates either with a per-personality path-allowlist.
//
// Path semantics: all paths are absolute. The interface does NOT manage a
// root — consumers compute absolute paths via ethosDir() (or analog) and
// pass them in. ScopedStorage enforces an allowlist by validating each
// absolute path against a configured set of allowed prefixes.
//
// Error semantics:
//   - read/exists/mtime return null when the target doesn't exist
//   - All other operations throw on failure
//   - ScopedStorage throws BoundaryError when a path is outside the allowlist
