// A2A audit sink — a METADATA-ONLY record that an A2A exchange happened (plan

// personality, which peer, which decision), never WHAT content was exchanged.

//
// Layer-pure: types + local logic only, zero imports. The concrete sink is
// injected by the app wiring (serve.ts) so `@ethosagent/a2a` never couples to a
// storage backend.
