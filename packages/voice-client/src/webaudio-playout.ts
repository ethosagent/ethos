// Absolute-time playout for talk-mode.
//
// The batch path played each clip with `new Audio(dataURL)`: nothing could
// start until the whole clip existed, and consecutive clips were paced by
// whenever the previous one's `ended` event happened to fire. Chaining playback
// off relative timers (or off `ended`) accumulates the scheduler's lateness —
// a few milliseconds per clip becomes an audible warble over a long call.
//
// (The output analyser is here for the same reason: the Call Stage's speaking
// state is amplitude-driven, and the only place the agent's own level exists is
// on this graph, between the scheduled sources and the destination.)
//
// Everything here schedules against the audio clock instead: each buffer starts
// at an ABSOLUTE time on the context's timeline, and the next one starts exactly
// where the previous one ends. Late delivery cannot compound, because the next
// start time is derived from the previous start time, never from "now".
