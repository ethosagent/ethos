// amplitude-driven motion — and fixes its constants in code rather than in
// config: the user picks a treatment and a color, nothing else. Everything that
// decides HOW the shape moves lives here, pure, so the rules that are hard to
// see in a draw call (which source drives which state, what reduced motion
// removes, where the smoothing happens) are unit tests rather than a reading of
// the render loop.
