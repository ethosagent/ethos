/**
 * The architecture validator — the mechanical projection of ARCHITECTURE.md.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. ARCHITECTURE.md §IX declares a parser contract: "a single YAML
 * document inside the first ```yaml fence whose first non-blank line is
 * `# ARCHITECTURE-RULES v1`. The validator reads this block plus
 * `.architecture-state.yaml` and exits non-zero on any unmatched violation."
 * This is that validator. The constitution is the source; this file is its
 * projection. Rules are READ from the fenced block and the sidecar — they are
 * not restated here, because a second copy is a second thing to drift.
 *
 * SCOPE. Tier completeness, the guarantee register (both directions), claims
 * about the register, §VIII exception shape for sidecar entries, and stale
 * kernel paths. The layer and law import rules are NOT here: archcheck enforces
 * them from architecture.config.ts (ARCHITECTURE.md §IX).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. A published control claim once survived the deletion of the
 * code that implemented it (plan/phases/security-boundary.md G11), because
 * nothing tied a claim to an enforcement point. Check 3 is that tie, in both
 * directions. Check 4 is the same tie one layer out: the sentences ELSEWHERE
 * that describe the register's size and membership, which drifted from it for
 * exactly the same reason — nothing was checking them.
 *
 * WHERE PROSE AND YAML CONFLICT, §IX says the prose wins. So a rule that cannot
 * be expressed mechanically is reported as UNENFORCED rather than approximated
 * — an approximate check that fails constitutionally-permitted code gets
 * switched off, and a switched-off check protects nothing.
 *
 * SEVERITY. Every finding is an error and exits non-zero.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/check-architecture.mjs
 *   node scripts/check-architecture.mjs --only exceptions,register
 *   node scripts/check-architecture.mjs --sidecar <path> --architecture <path> --root <path>

 * Check 3 ties every claim IN the register to code. Nothing tied the claims

 * thing it described, with nothing mechanical to notice.
 *
 * WHY A MARKER AND NOT A GREP. Extracting "how many guarantees does this
 * sentence claim" from English is a heuristic in both directions: a regex loose
 * enough to catch "a closed list of ten security guarantees" also fires on
 * unrelated numerals, and one tight enough to avoid that misses the next
 * rephrasing — and a check that misses the rewrite is exactly the check that
 * was missing here. So the claim is DECLARED, in the file that makes it, next
 * to the prose that makes it.
 *
 * WHY THE DECLARATION IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. A marker alone moves the drift
 * rather than removing it: the marker would track the register while the
 * sentence beside it went stale, which is the bug verbatim. So the tie is
 * three-way and every link is exact — the marker's ids must equal the
 * register's rows in order, and the prose the marker sits on must contain the
 * count the marker implies, plus each name the marker pairs with a row.
 *
 *   <!-- register-claim
 *        ids:   G-TOOLS, G-CAP, …
 *        names: tool allowlist, capability scoping, …
 *   -->
 *   Ethos publishes a closed list of twelve security guarantees …
 *
 * `ids` is required and positional; `names` is optional and, when present,
 * pairs positionally with `ids`, so a reader can audit which phrase stands for
 * which row. The count is never written in the marker — it is the length of
 * `ids`, because a number stated twice is a number that can disagree with
 * itself.
