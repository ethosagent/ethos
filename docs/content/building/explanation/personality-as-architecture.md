## Context

Most agent frameworks treat "personality" as a string. You hand the model a system prompt — "you are a careful reviewer" — and the agent's voice shifts. Its tools do not. Its memory does not. Its model does not. The runtime is one generalist with a costume rack.

A [personality](../../getting-started/glossary.md#personality) in Ethos is something else. It is a structural component of the runtime. A directory at `~/.ethos/personalities/<id>/` with three files inside it. Switching to it atomically rebinds four dimensions of the agent: which prompt it carries, which [tools](../../getting-started/glossary.md#tool) it can call, which memory file it reads and writes, and which model handles its turns. The four move together because the framework refuses to expose them as independent knobs.

This page is the headline thesis. It explains why "personality is architecture" is a load-bearing claim rather than slogan, what the structural shape buys you that a prompt string cannot, and what the design explicitly refuses to let inside the boundary. The [using-side page](../../using/explanation/what-is-a-personality.md) covers the user-facing story of switching personalities mid-chat; this page is for the developer asking why the schema is shaped this way.

## Discussion

### The four dimensions, joined at the registry

A personality directory contains exactly three files. None of them is optional.

```
~/.ethos/personalities/<id>/
├── SOUL.md        first-person identity — who am I, how do I speak
├── config.yaml     name, model, memoryScope, fs_reach, mcp_servers, plugins
└── toolset.yaml    flat list of allowed tool names
```

`SOUL.md` becomes the system prompt baseline. `config.yaml` parameterises model routing, [memory scope](../../getting-started/glossary.md#memory-scope), filesystem reach, MCP allowlist, plugin allowlist. `toolset.yaml` is the allowlist `DefaultToolRegistry.toDefinitions(allowedTools)` filters the visible toolset against.

When you switch personality, all four change in one step. The `AgentLoop.run()` generator reads the active personality once at the top of the turn (see `packages/core/src/agent-loop.ts`) and uses it to parameterise every subsystem call: which model to ask, which tools to expose, which memory directory to resolve, which MCP servers and plugins to fire. None of those subsystems know about the others. The personality is the binding point.

This is the structural property. The four dimensions are not bundled by convention. They are bundled because the personality is the only thing that knows about all four, and the framework reads it on every turn.

### A `PersonalityConfig` is a contract, not a config dump

The schema lives at `packages/types/src/personality.ts`. It has zero runtime dependencies — anyone in the monorepo can import the type without dragging in concrete implementations. The interface is small and load-bearing: `id`, `name`, `toolset`, `model`, `memoryScope`, `fs_reach`, `mcp_servers`, `plugins`, `safety`, plus a handful of nested leaves like `skill_evolution` and `context_layering`.

The fact that the *count* is enforced is the design statement. A CI test (`packages/types/src/__tests__/personality-field-count.test.ts`) parses the interface, counts its fields, and fails if the result drifts from `.personality-field-count` at the repo root. Adding a field requires the `personality-schema-change` label, two-maintainer approval, and a bump to the count file in the same commit.

The friction is deliberate. The schema is the load-bearing surface — it is the answer to "what is a personality" expressed as code. Letting it accrete fields would turn the directory into a god object that knows about voice modes, response templates, channel UI, and three other concerns that do not belong here. The CLAUDE.md note is blunt: voice / TTS, emotion / sentiment, label templates, and per-channel UI affordances have all been refused. Each is a real product need; none is a personality concern.

### Concretely, what `loadFromDirectory` does

The mechanical loader lives at `extensions/personalities/src/index.ts`. `FilePersonalityRegistry.loadFromDirectory(dir)` walks the immediate subdirectories of `dir`, reads each one's three files, and produces a `PersonalityConfig` for each valid directory.

A "valid directory" is the minimum the contract asks: an `SOUL.md` (at least empty), a `config.yaml` with at least `name`, and a `toolset.yaml` (which may be an empty list). Missing files produce a load-time error pointing at the directory and the field; malformed YAML produces a parse error with the line number. The loader does not guess.

The per-directory load is `mtime`-fingerprinted. The registry caches the parsed `PersonalityConfig` keyed by directory id; on the next `loadFromDirectory` call, it stats the three files and reuses the cached config if no `mtime` changed. Calling `loadFromDirectory` per turn is cheap on the steady state and reflects edits on the changed-files state.

The implication: a personality directory is the unit of *configuration change*. Editing one file in one directory updates one personality. There is no global rebuild, no migration, no restart. The mechanism is the property; the property is what makes the iterative workflow ("tune the reviewer's tone, send a message, see the change") work.

### What the structure buys you

Three things you cannot get from a prompt string.

**Enforcement instead of advice.** The toolset is filtered at the registry. `DefaultToolRegistry.toDefinitions(allowedTools)` returns only the tool definitions the personality allows; the LLM literally cannot see a tool outside the allowlist. A defensive second check runs in `executeParallel` — calls to disallowed names return `{ ok: false, code: 'not_available' }` with the Anthropic message contract preserved (every `tool_use` still gets a `tool_result`). A reviewer with no `write_file` in its toolset cannot edit a file regardless of how persuasive a prompt-injection payload sounds. The boundary is the registry; the prompt is the explanation.

**Atomic switching.** When you go from `engineer` to `reviewer` in chat, the model swap, the toolset swap, the memory scope swap, and the prompt swap happen as one operation. There is no transient state where the engineer's write tools are exposed under the reviewer's prompt. The atomicity is what makes "the reviewer cannot edit" credible — it cannot become "the reviewer cannot edit, except for one stray turn during the switch".

**Legibility.** A personality is plain text. You can `cat SOUL.md`, `grep` your toolsets, `diff` two versions, and commit the directory to a repo. The reviewer your team uses for code review is in source control next to the code it reviews. Memory you cannot read is memory you cannot trust; the same logic applies to identity. The `FilePersonalityRegistry` at `extensions/personalities/src/index.ts` is one implementation of the `PersonalityRegistry` interface; a remote registry, a database-backed one, or a hot-reloading network share are straight ports of the contract.

### The five built-ins are not five prompt presets

Ethos ships five [built-in personalities](../../getting-started/glossary.md#built-in-personality) at `extensions/personalities/data/`: `researcher`, `engineer`, `reviewer`, `coach`, `operator`. They are not five voices on top of one agent. Each has its own toolset, its own memory scope, and a model assignment that suits its work.

| Personality | What its `toolset.yaml` allows | `memoryScope` |
|---|---|---|
| `researcher` | Read, search, web, citations | `global` |
| `engineer` | Read, write, run, test | `global` |
| `reviewer` | Read-only | `per-personality` |
| `coach` | Read, search | `global` |
| `operator` | Process, network, terminal | `per-personality` |

The `reviewer` is `per-personality` on purpose: opinions about what was reviewed should not leak into what gets built. The `operator` is `per-personality` because operational state ("we paged at 03:00") should not bleed into a casual `coach` session. The other three share `global` memory because their work composes — a researcher gathering primary sources hands context to an engineer who acts on it.

If you set out to replicate this with prompt strings, you would write five prompts, document the convention of "only use these tools when prompt X is active", and hope every caller honoured it. The structural form makes the convention impossible to violate.

### The schema-freeze rule, restated for builders

The "what does not belong on `PersonalityConfig`" question is the one that comes up repeatedly. Four categories the schema has refused, with the reason each was rejected:

- **Voice modes / TTS settings.** Voice is the channel adapter's concern. Telegram does not speak; the email adapter does not stream audio. Putting voice on the personality assumes one surface.
- **Emotion / mood / sentiment tags.** Mood is a presentation hint, not a structural property. A reviewer being "cautious" is its identity (`SOUL.md`), not a flag.
- **Response templates.** A skill is the unit for "how do I phrase a code-review comment". Templates belong to skills because they are reusable across personalities.
- **Per-channel UI affordances.** Button labels, card layouts, Slack block kit — these are channel-adapter concerns. A personality does not know which surface is rendering it.

Each rejection has the same shape: the property is real, but the personality is not its right home. Mixing them in would mean every channel adapter, every skill, and every surface negotiates with the personality directory. The clean separation is what makes the personality a *unit*.

### Hot reload as a property of the file format

`FilePersonalityRegistry.loadFromDirectory()` fingerprints each personality's three files by `mtime`. Calling it on every turn is cheap when nothing changed; when one of the three files changes on disk, the next turn sees the new content. No restart, no session loss, no cache to invalidate by hand.

This is the property that lets you tune a personality interactively. Edit `SOUL.md`, send the next message, watch the voice change. Edit `toolset.yaml`, ask the agent to do something it now cannot do, see the rejection. The fast feedback loop is the difference between "I can iterate on this personality" and "I have to restart the process to see if my edit worked".

The performance cost is one `stat` per file per turn. For a registry with twenty personalities that is sixty stat calls before the model is asked anything. On a fast filesystem this is in the noise; on a network filesystem it is measurable but bounded.

### The `fs_reach` boundary is the personality's filesystem identity

A personality's `config.yaml` can declare `fs_reach`:

```yaml
fs_reach:
  read:
    - ${ETHOS_HOME}/personalities/${self}/
    - ${ETHOS_HOME}/skills/
    - ${CWD}
  write:
    - ${ETHOS_HOME}/personalities/${self}/
    - ${CWD}
```

The substitutions resolve at `AgentLoop` construction time: `${ETHOS_HOME}` becomes `~/.ethos`, `${self}` becomes the personality's id, `${CWD}` becomes the agent's working directory. The resolved lists are handed to a `ScopedStorage` decorator that wraps the framework's `Storage`. Any read or write outside the allowlist raises a `BoundaryError`.

The file tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `patch_file`, `search_files`) route through `ToolContext.storage`, which is the scoped storage. A researcher with no write entries cannot write; a personality whose read scope is `~/.ethos/personalities/${self}/` cannot peek at another personality's memory file. The CLAUDE.md note frames this as a defence-in-depth property — the toolset already restricts which file tool the LLM can call, and the scoped storage stops the tool from doing harm even if it was called.

This is the [fs_reach](../../getting-started/glossary.md#fs-reach) boundary. It is distinct from the storage scope of the framework itself; both enforce the personality's filesystem identity, just at different layers.

### The personality determines model routing

`personality.model` is a string label — Anthropic-specific by historical accident, and intentionally skipped when the wiring resolves the actual model. The CLAUDE.md note explains: those IDs break non-Anthropic providers (OpenRouter, Gemini, Ollama), so the wiring layer routes through an explicit `modelRouting` map in `~/.ethos/config.yaml` keyed by personality id.

The shape is two-step. `~/.ethos/config.yaml` declares `modelRouting: { researcher: claude-opus-4-7, engineer: claude-sonnet-4-6 }`. The wiring passes that map to `AgentLoopConfig.modelRouting`. `AgentLoop.run()` looks up the active personality's id, finds the model, and uses it for this turn's LLM call. Personalities can also declare a `streamingTimeoutMs` so a slow-thinking model (Opus extended thinking) gets a longer watchdog than a fast one (Haiku).

The model is part of the personality's structural identity even when the value comes from a side table. Picking Opus for `researcher` and Sonnet for `engineer` is a deliberate role decision, not a knob set per turn.

### How the wiring threads a personality into the loop

`AgentLoopConfig` (see `packages/core/src/agent-loop.ts`) takes a `PersonalityRegistry`, not a single personality. The registry is the source of truth — `loadFromDirectory` discovers personalities, `get(id)` returns one, `getDefault()` returns the active default. `AgentLoop.run()` resolves the active personality from `opts.personalityId` or the default, then uses it to:

- Filter the visible toolset (`personality.toolset?.length ? personality.toolset : undefined`)
- Build the MCP server allowlist (`personality.mcp_servers ?? []`)
- Build the plugin allowlist (`personality.plugins ?? []`)
- Resolve the per-personality `fs_reach` into a `ScopedStorage`
- Apply `personality.context_engine` and `context_engine_options` to compaction
- Apply `personality.safety.injectionDefense` to untrusted-output handling
- Apply `personality.streamingTimeoutMs` to the LLM watchdog

The CLI's `apps/ethos/src/wiring.ts` and the shared `packages/wiring/src/index.ts` are where this assembly happens. The point worth noticing: `AgentLoop` knows nothing about how the personality got loaded. The registry is an interface; the file-system implementation is one choice. The same loop runs against an in-memory registry in tests with no special wiring.

### The schema is FROZEN — what the comment in the source says

`packages/types/src/personality.ts` opens with a comment block that is more important than it looks:

```
// Phase 30.8 — this schema is FROZEN.
//
// Adding a top-level field to `PersonalityConfig` requires:
//   1. A CHANGELOG entry justifying why it isn't a skill, a tool, or a memory section.
//   2. The `personality-schema-change` label on the PR.
//   3. Two-maintainer approval (enforced via branch protection).
//   4. Bumping the count in `.personality-field-count` at the repo root.
```

The mechanical CI gate (`packages/types/src/__tests__/personality-field-count.test.ts`) parses the interface and fails if the count drifts. Culture sets the rule; CI enforces it. The combination is what keeps the schema small even as the project grows.

The "common rejections" comment is below the freeze notice — the four categories already listed (voice modes, emotion tags, response templates, channel UI). They sit in the source as a reminder to the next contributor reaching for "just one more field".

### Why a directory and not a database row

A personality is a directory because:

You can read it. `cat ~/.ethos/personalities/reviewer/SOUL.md` is a complete answer to "what does the reviewer do". That answer survives `grep`, `diff`, code review, and `git log`. A database row is a query away from being readable, and the query never survives a migration.

You can version it. Commit the directory to a repo and the personality your team uses is in source control alongside the code it operates on. There is no separate "personality database" to back up, restore, or replicate across machines.

You can swap the backend without changing the contract. `PersonalityRegistry` is an interface; `FilePersonalityRegistry` is one implementation. A remote registry that fetches personalities from a service is the same contract with a different `loadFromDirectory`. The data model — three files, a memory scope, a toolset — is what's invariant.

You can hand-edit it. `SOUL.md` is markdown. `config.yaml` is `key: value` YAML. `toolset.yaml` is a flat list. No GUI, no admin panel, no migration tool — the file is the source of truth.

### Plugins and MCP servers are default-deny

A globally configured MCP server in `~/.ethos/mcp.json` is invisible to a personality unless that personality's `mcp_servers` list names it. An installed plugin from `extensions/plugin-loader` is dormant for a personality unless the personality's `plugins` list opts in.

This is a deliberate inversion of the "if it's installed, the agent can use it" default in most frameworks. The personality is the gate. A user who installs a database MCP server does not implicitly hand database access to every personality; the `engineer` declares `mcp_servers: [postgres]` to opt in, and the `coach` simply does not. Same machine, same installed servers, different reach per role.

The mechanism is the same registry filter that gates tools. `DefaultToolRegistry.toDefinitions(allowedTools, { allowedMcpServers, allowedPlugins })` builds the per-turn tool list from three allowlists in one pass. The LLM never sees an MCP tool from an unauthorised server; `executeParallel` rejects calls outside the allowlist with `code: 'not_available'`.

The CLAUDE.md note labels the convention: missing or empty means no access. There is no "default-allow when unset"; the absence of a list is itself a decision.

### What the personality does not control

Some boundaries are *not* personality-scoped, on purpose. Switching personalities does not change:

- The current [session](../../getting-started/glossary.md#session) and its history. The thread continues; the next message reaches a different role.
- `USER.md`. Who you are is a person fact, not a role fact.
- LLM credentials. Personalities pick a model; the keys live in `~/.ethos/config.yaml`.
- The CLI surface and channel adapters. Telegram and Discord do not reload when you `/personality coach`.

The personality controls "what the agent does and says". The boundary it does not control is "who you are and where you are". Those distinctions keep the user in continuous control of the session while the role shifts beneath them.

### Identity is in the `SOUL.md`, not the schema

A subtle property of the design is what *isn't* in `PersonalityConfig`. There is no `tone`, no `style`, no `personality_traits`. The agent's voice and reasoning style live in `SOUL.md` — markdown, first-person, opinionated. The schema is the structural surface; the prose is the identity.

This split is load-bearing. A future you can read `SOUL.md` and reason about who the agent is. A future you can read `config.yaml` and reason about what the agent can touch. Mixing them — putting "be concise" alongside `memoryScope` — would smear the boundary; structural and behavioural concerns would interleave on every page of the spec.

The cost is `SOUL.md` carries the load of being readable, opinionated, and concrete. The CLAUDE.md note labels the convention: *first-person identity (who am I, how do I speak)*. A vague `SOUL.md` produces vague behaviour. The reviewer's `SOUL.md` reads "I am a critical, evidence-based reviewer. I cite specific lines. I refuse to soften concerns to be polite." Not "you are a careful reviewer". The grammatical first person is harder for the model to argue itself out of.

### The skills layer sits underneath, not inside

A common confusion: "is a [skill](../../getting-started/glossary.md#skill) part of a personality?" The answer is no — skills are discovered globally and filtered per personality by tool reach.

`extensions/skills/` walks several discovery roots (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/`, `~/.opencode/skills/`, `~/.hermes/skills/`, `~/.ethos/skills/`) and produces a global skill pool. For each personality, an ingest filter checks whether each skill's `required_tools` are a subset of the personality's effective tool reach. The researcher sees skills whose required tools are read/search/browse; the engineer sees skills that touch write/run/test; the reviewer sees only read-only skills.

This means a skill the user installed for `engineer` does not implicitly load under `reviewer`. The skill is the same file on disk, but the per-personality filter makes it invisible to roles that lack the tools to execute it. The personality is the gate; the skill is the reusable capability that passes through it.

### How this differs from neighbouring frameworks

The honest comparison lives at [Why Ethos?](../../getting-started/why-ethos.md). The short form, for this page's purposes:

LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen — "personality" means setting a system prompt string. Tool access, memory, and model selection are independent knobs you wire together by hand. Most teams don't, and the four dimensions drift apart.

OpenClaw — closer to Ethos's model: per-agent toolsets and a prompt file. The structural binding is partial: memory scope and model routing are not first-class personality properties; they live in a separate config layer.

Hermes — emphasises persistent learning loops and self-modifying skills. A "persona" in Hermes is closer to a role label than a structural unit; the agent's tools and memory are global to the runtime, not scoped to the role.

Ethos's claim is that *all four* dimensions move together, every time, and that the framework refuses to let them be set independently. The cost of that claim is the schema-freeze rule and the directory-of-files format. The benefit is that "the reviewer cannot edit" is true the same way that "the file is owned by root" is true: enforced, not requested.

## Trade-offs

**You give up the one-super-agent mental model.** Every distinct role is a directory you commit to. Five roles is five directories, fifteen files. The alternative — one agent with a `mode` field and per-mode tool filters — was rejected because the resulting code path branches on the mode flag and the boundaries leak.

**You commit to a small schema.** `PersonalityConfig` is frozen. If you want a new top-level field, you do the work of justifying why it is not a [skill](../../getting-started/glossary.md#skill), not a channel-adapter config, and not a per-tool option. The friction is the feature; without it the schema would have grown to the same god-object shape every other framework's persona config eventually does.

**You give up cross-personality memory by default.** A `per-personality` memory scope means the reviewer cannot see the engineer's notes. This is intentional — opinions about what was reviewed should not leak into what gets built — but it has to be reasoned about per personality. Use `global` scope when continuity matters across roles; use `per-personality` when isolation matters more.

**You give up dynamic per-turn personality assembly.** A personality is loaded at the start of the turn and used for the duration of that turn. You cannot rewrite the toolset mid-turn or swap models on the fly. The structural unit is the turn-bound role, not the per-LLM-call configuration. Use a [mesh](../../getting-started/glossary.md#mesh) of personalities (`extensions/agent-mesh/`, `extensions/team-supervisor/`) when you need different roles in one workflow.

**You pay a small cost on every turn.** The mtime-fingerprinted reload is cheap but not zero — three `stat` calls per personality per turn. On a fast filesystem this is negligible; on a network filesystem it is measurable. The trade is the live-edit story: tuning a personality without restarting beats process restart costs by a large margin.

Alternatives considered:

- A single `personality.yaml` with a `mode` field. Rejected: the four dimensions had to move together, and a single config with a mode-flag branch is a god object the schema cannot defend.
- Personality as a function in code. Rejected: defeats hot reload, defeats version control of identity, defeats the "team shares a reviewer" workflow.
- Personality as a database row. Rejected: not readable, not greppable, requires a migration to add a field, no `diff` story.
- Tool access as a separate file unrelated to the personality. Rejected: the atomic-swap property is the headline. Joining tool access to the personality at the directory level keeps the four dimensions visibly coupled; splitting them invites drift where a personality "is" a reviewer but "can" write.
- Personality overlays / inheritance. Rejected as overengineering for v1. Five built-ins, duplicate-and-edit, is enough; overlays add a layer that obscures what a personality actually is.
