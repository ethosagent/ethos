## Task

Run the Ethos [gateway](../getting-started/glossary.md#gateway) against a Slack workspace in a way that survives real traffic: install a socket-mode app with the right scopes, route `app_mention` and DMs to per-channel [sessions](../getting-started/glossary.md#session), restrict who can talk to the bot, stay under Slack's send rate, run a second workspace's app from the same host, and recognise the failure modes when they arrive.

## Result

- A Slack app runs in **Socket Mode** — no public URL, no TLS, no event-subscription endpoint.
- The bot replies to `@mentions` in channels and to DMs; it never reaches for messages it was not addressed in.
- Channels, threads, and DMs each get their own session keyed `slack:<channel-id>` / `slack:<thread-ts>` / `slack:<channel-id>` (DMs are channels of type `im`).
- Outbound text is split into 3,000-character chunks, deduped over a 30-second window, and edited in place when the agent streams.
- A second workspace's app runs from a sibling `~/.ethos/` without interfering with the first.

## Prereqs

- `ethos chat` works locally with a configured LLM provider.
- A Slack app created at `https://api.slack.com/apps` → **Create New App** → **From scratch**.
- The app installed to the target workspace; the bot user added to at least one channel.
- Three secrets in hand: bot token (`xoxb-…`), app-level token (`xapp-…`) with `connections:write`, and the signing secret.

## Source

- `extensions/platform-slack/src/index.ts` — `SlackAdapter` (Bolt SDK in `socketMode: true`, chunking, edit-in-place).
- `extensions/platform-slack/src/validate.ts` — `auth.test`-based bot-token validation called by setup.
- `extensions/gateway/src/index.ts` — routing, slash commands, dedup, allowlist enforcement.
- `extensions/safety-channel/src/channel-filter.ts` — sender allowlist, mention gate, DM policy.
- `apps/ethos/src/commands/gateway.ts` — adapter wiring (`new SlackAdapter({ botToken, appToken, signingSecret })`).

## Steps

### 1. Create the Slack app

In `https://api.slack.com/apps`:

1. **Create New App** → **From scratch**. Pick a name and the target workspace.
2. Under **OAuth & Permissions** → **Bot Token Scopes**, add:
   - `app_mentions:read` — receive mention events.
   - `channels:history` — read messages in public channels the bot is in.
   - `groups:history` — same for private channels.
   - `im:history` — read DMs to the bot.
   - `im:read` — list DM channels.
   - `im:write` — open DM channels for outbound messages.
   - `chat:write` — post messages and edit them.
   - `users:read` — resolve user ids when audit-logging.
3. Under **Socket Mode** → **Enable Socket Mode**.
4. Under **Basic Information** → **App-Level Tokens** → **Generate Token and Scopes**, add the `connections:write` scope. Copy the `xapp-…` token.
5. Under **Event Subscriptions** → **Enable Events**, subscribe to bot events:
   - `app_mention`
   - `message.im`
6. Under **Install App**, install to the workspace. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`).
7. Under **Basic Information**, copy the **Signing Secret**.

### 2. Wire the secrets

```yaml
# ~/.ethos/config.yaml
slackBotToken: "xoxb-…"
slackAppToken: "xapp-…"
slackSigningSecret: "abc123…"
```

`ethos gateway setup` validates the bot token against `https://slack.com/api/auth.test` and writes all three fields. The gateway requires all three to be set before it loads the adapter (see `apps/ethos/src/commands/gateway.ts`).

### 3. Start the gateway

```bash
ethos gateway start
```

Expected boot lines include `⚡️ Bolt app started`. For production, wrap the same command in `launchd`, `systemd`, or `pm2` — see [Run Ethos as a daemon](../using/how-to/run-as-daemon.md). Socket Mode means no reverse proxy, no domain, no inbound port.

### 4. Understand routing

`SlackAdapter.start()` subscribes to two events (`extensions/platform-slack/src/index.ts`):

- `message` — fires for every DM the bot can see. The adapter accepts messages with `channel_type === 'im'`; everything else is ignored at this layer.
- `app_mention` — fires for `@mentions` in channels. The adapter strips the `<@UXXXXXXXX>` token before forwarding.

| Source | `chatId` | `isDm` | `isGroupMention` | Effective session key |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Channel `@mention` | channel id `C…` | `false` | `true` | `slack:<channel-id>` |
| Thread (channel mention with `thread_ts`) | channel id | `false` | `true` | `slack:<channel-id>` (replies go to the thread) |
| DM | channel id `D…` (type `im`) | `true` | `false` | `slack:<channel-id>` |

When the inbound message has a `thread_ts` or the `replyToId` is set, the adapter passes `thread_ts` to `chat.postMessage` so the reply lands in the same thread. New top-level mentions start a new thread when the agent's reply spans multiple chunks.

The adapter skips messages with any `subtype` (bot messages, edits, joins) — Bolt surfaces those as `message` events too.

### 5. Restrict who can talk to the bot

Configure under `channelFilter.slack` (`extensions/safety-channel/src/channel-filter.ts`):

```yaml
channelFilter:
  slack:
    ownerUserId: "U01ABCDEFGH"            # Slack user id — always allowed
    recipientAllowlist:
      - "U02ABCDEFGH"                     # extra user ids
      - "C03ABCDEFGH"                     # or whole channel ids
    dmPolicy: pairing                     # pairing | allowlist | queue | reject | silent-drop
    contextVisibility: allowlist          # strip quoted text from non-allowlisted senders
```

Field meanings:

- `ownerUserId` — bypasses every gate, including the channel mention gate.
- `recipientAllowlist` — Slack user ids and channel ids that are also allowed.
- `dmPolicy` — what happens when a non-allowlisted user DMs the bot. `pairing` (default) replies with a one-time code; `allowlist` silently drops; the rest match the [Telegram adapter](telegram.md).
- `contextVisibility: allowlist` — strips quoted Slack-thread content from non-allowlisted senders before the agent sees it.

From inside `ethos chat`:

```
/communications
/allow 7H3K-9XQ2
/deny slack U02ABCDEFGH
```

### 6. Drive multi-workspace deployments

A Slack app is installed per workspace. Each installation issues its own bot token. To run the same Ethos app across several workspaces:

- Run several gateways with separate `~/.ethos/` directories:

```bash
HOME=/srv/ethos-workspace-a ethos gateway start &
HOME=/srv/ethos-workspace-b ethos gateway start &
```

Each `HOME` carries its own `slackBotToken`, `slackAppToken`, `slackSigningSecret`, SQLite store, logs, and pairing database. The bots stay isolated; sessions never cross.

- Or run one gateway against one workspace and add Telegram or Discord tokens alongside. The same `MessageDedupCache` (30s TTL, keyed by `(sessionId, sha256(content))`) suppresses duplicate outbound text on the same session across every adapter.

A single Slack adapter instance binds to one bot token. Multi-tenant Slack distribution (one app, many workspaces, OAuth per workspace) is not yet wired through `apps/ethos/src/commands/gateway.ts`.

## Verify

**Token works.**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://slack.com/api/auth.test | jq .ok
```

Returns `true` along with the team name. `false` or `invalid_auth` means the bot token is wrong; reinstall the app.

**Gateway sees Slack.**

Foreground-start the gateway and confirm `⚡️ Bolt app started`. The adapter's `health()` calls `auth.test` and reports `ok` plus latency.

**Mention round-trips in a channel.**

In a channel the bot is a member of, post `@Ethos ping`. Reply arrives within a few seconds.

**DM round-trips.**

DM the bot `ping`. Reply arrives. If you set `dmPolicy: pairing`, the first DM from a non-allowlisted user gets a pairing code instead.

**Thread routing.**

Reply to one of the bot's messages inside the thread. The bot's next reply lands in the same thread (via `thread_ts`).

**Allowlist enforcement.**

Have a non-allowlisted account `@mention` the bot. With the default config, the message is silently dropped; `ethos audit | tail` shows `channel.allowlist.blocked` or `channel.mention_gate`.

**Dedup is active.**

Send the same prompt twice within 30 seconds. The bot answers once if generated text is identical.

## Troubleshoot

**`⚡️ Bolt app started` prints but the bot ignores every message.**
Either `app_mention` / `message.im` are not subscribed in **Event Subscriptions**, or Socket Mode is off. Both are required.

**Bot replies in a channel it was just invited to but not in another.**
Slack scopes are per-channel for `channels:history` and `groups:history`. Invite the bot to each channel you want it active in. `app_mention` works regardless of channel membership, but reading thread history does not.

**HTTP 429 / `ratelimited` from `chat.postMessage`.**
Slack's tier-3 rate limit is ~50 calls per minute per workspace. Streaming edits stay under this because `reflowChunks` edits in place. Sustained 429s mean two gateways share a bot token or a personality is auto-replying. Check `ethos errors` and the running gateway count.

**`not_in_channel` from `chat.postMessage`.**
The bot user is not a member of the target channel. Invite the bot to the channel.

**`missing_scope` errors.**
The bot lacks a scope the gateway needs. Reinstall the app after adding the scope under **OAuth & Permissions**; reinstallation issues a new bot token, so update `slackBotToken` in `~/.ethos/config.yaml` after.

**Replies arrive split into multiple messages.**
Expected. The adapter caps outbound text at 3,000 characters per `chat.postMessage` to leave headroom under Slack's 4,000-character block limit; `chunkText` splits at newlines (>60% of the limit). Streamed edits re-flow — first chunks are edited, extras are appended, trailing chunks are deleted.

**Replies in a thread show up as top-level channel messages.**
The inbound message had no `thread_ts`. Reply to one of the bot's existing messages in the thread to seed it, or include `thread_ts` when calling the gateway directly.

**A message sent twice on purpose was answered only once.**
The outbound `MessageDedupCache` suppresses identical `(sessionId, content)` within 30 seconds. Change one character, wait 30 seconds, or set `ETHOS_DEDUP_LEGACY=1` to disable.

**Pairing code expired.**
Codes have a TTL in `extensions/safety-channel/src/pairing-store.ts`. If the DM author waited too long, they need to DM again. Owners can `/communications approve-all` to approve every pending sender.

**Socket Mode reconnects every few minutes.**
Slack rotates the WebSocket; Bolt reconnects automatically. Persistent flapping points at a network or proxy issue between the host and `wss.slack.com`. The signing secret is only checked for HTTP event endpoints, so it does not cause socket disconnects.

## Errors you may see

| Code | Surface | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `channel.allowlist.blocked` | gateway audit | Non-allowlisted sender in a channel, or DM under `dmPolicy: silent-drop`. | Add the user id to `recipientAllowlist` or trigger `/allow <code>`. |
| `channel.mention_gate` | gateway audit | Allowlisted sender posted in a channel without `@mentioning` the bot. | Mention the bot or reply in-thread. |
| `channel.pairing.sent` | gateway audit | First DM from a non-allowlisted user; pairing code emitted. | Owner runs `/allow <code>` to approve. |
| `channel.context_stripped` | gateway audit | Quoted thread content from a non-allowlisted user was removed before the turn. | Expected when `contextVisibility: allowlist`. |
| `invalid_auth` | adapter health | Bot token revoked or wrong. | Reinstall the app, copy the new `xoxb-…` token. |
| `not_in_channel` | delivery result | Bot is not a member of the target channel. | Invite the bot. |
| `missing_scope` | delivery result | App lacks a Bot Token Scope. | Add the scope, reinstall, update the token. |
