## Task

Run Ethos against a model hosted on Amazon Bedrock, and pick the credential path that fits where Ethos runs — an EC2 instance, an ECS task, an EKS pod, or a laptop logged in with `aws sso login`.

## Result

`ethos chat` streams tokens from Bedrock. On an AWS host with an IAM role attached, no credential is configured anywhere: Ethos resolves one through the standard AWS credential chain and re-resolves it as it expires.

## Prereqs

- `ethos` on `PATH` (Node 24+). Run `ethos --version` to confirm.
- Model access granted for the model you want, in the AWS region you plan to call. Bedrock model access is per-account and per-region — request it once in the Bedrock console under **Model access**.
- An IAM identity Ethos can assume or authenticate as. What that looks like depends on the credential path you choose below.
- Write access to `~/.ethos/config.yaml`.

## Steps

### 1. Get the model id

Bedrock model ids are account- and region-dependent. Copy the exact id from the Bedrock console under **Model catalog** → the model → **Model ID**, or list them from the CLI:

```bash
aws bedrock list-inference-profiles --region <your-region> \
  --query 'inferenceProfileSummaries[].inferenceProfileId' --output text
```

```
us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6	us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0
```

An id prefixed `us.` is a *cross-region inference profile* — it routes a request to whichever US region has capacity. A bare id like `anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` is a single-region foundation model. Either works; the prefix matters when you write the IAM policy in step 3.

### 2. Choose a credential path

Ethos resolves Bedrock credentials in a fixed priority order. The first source that resolves wins.

| Priority | Source | Where it lives | Use it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Ethos [secret](../../getting-started/glossary.md#secret) store (sensitive material Ethos resolves at runtime) | `providers/bedrock/accessKeyId`, `providers/bedrock/secretAccessKey`, `providers/bedrock/sessionToken` | You hold a long-lived or externally-minted key pair and want it vaulted with every other Ethos credential. |
| 2 | AWS node credential chain **(Recommended)** | Nothing configured in Ethos — the chain finds it | Anywhere else. |

**Use the credential chain unless you have a specific reason not to.** It is the only path where nothing expires in your care: credentials from an instance role, a task role, IRSA, or an SSO session are short-lived and refreshed automatically on each signed request. A static key pair in the secret store is a credential you now own the rotation of.

#### Option A — The credential chain (Recommended)

Configure no Bedrock credential in Ethos at all. When the secret store holds no `providers/bedrock/accessKeyId`, Ethos falls back to the standard AWS node credential provider chain, in this order:

1. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables
2. A profile in `~/.aws/config` or `~/.aws/credentials` — named by `awsProfile:` in `~/.ethos/config.yaml`, else `AWS_PROFILE`, else `default`. An SSO profile resolves from the session `aws sso login` cached.
3. An EKS web-identity token (IRSA)
4. ECS container credentials (`taskRoleArn`)
5. EC2 instance metadata (the instance role)

Steps 3 through 5 are the zero-config deployments. Attach the role and set nothing:

| Where Ethos runs | What you attach |
|---|---|
| EC2 | An instance profile carrying the Bedrock policy from step 3 |
| ECS | `taskRoleArn` on the task definition |
| EKS | An `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation on the pod's service account (IRSA) |

On a laptop, log in first:

```bash
aws sso login --profile my-sso
```

Then name that profile in `~/.ethos/config.yaml`, so it applies to every process that runs Ethos:

```yaml
awsProfile: my-sso
```

The key is `awsProfile:`, not `profile:` — `profile` already means a per-model `ModelProfile` under `models.*` in this config. Ethos passes it to the chain as the profile to select.

`AWS_PROFILE` in the environment does the same job and is the better fit when one machine switches between accounts:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=my-sso ethos chat
```

`awsProfile:` wins when both are set. Omit both and the chain falls back to `AWS_PROFILE`, then the `default` profile, then the non-profile sources.

#### Option B — A key pair in the secret store

Store the pair under the `providers/bedrock/` refs. `ethos secrets set` writes to `~/.ethos/secrets/`:

```bash
ethos secrets set providers/bedrock/accessKeyId AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
ethos secrets set providers/bedrock/secretAccessKey <your-secret-access-key>
```

```
✓ Secret set: providers/bedrock/accessKeyId
✓ Secret set: providers/bedrock/secretAccessKey
```

For temporary credentials from `aws sts assume-role`, add the third ref:

```bash
ethos secrets set providers/bedrock/sessionToken <your-session-token>
```

These are ordinary secret refs, so any backend in the [resolver precedence chain](../reference/secrets-resolver.md#resolver-precedence) can supply them — `~/.ethos/.env`, a process environment variable (`PROVIDERS_BEDROCK_ACCESSKEYID`), or AWS Secrets Manager when `aws.secrets.enabled: true`.

A session token from `assume-role` expires. Ethos does not renew it — that is the cost of choosing this path over the chain.

### 3. Grant the IAM permission

Ethos calls Bedrock's `ConverseStream` operation. The action is `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`, and it is the only Bedrock action Ethos needs.

Attach the [Bedrock inference role](../reference/aws-iam-policies.md#bedrock-inference-role) policy to whichever identity step 2 resolves — the instance profile, the task role, the IRSA service-account role, the SSO permission set, or the IAM user behind the static key pair.

### 4. Point the config at Bedrock

The wizard covers it. `ethos setup` lists **AWS Bedrock**, skips the API-key prompt, and asks for the model id as free text — Bedrock ids are account- and region-specific, so there is no list to pick from.

```bash
ethos setup
```

To hand-edit instead, `~/.ethos/config.yaml` needs three keys:

```yaml
provider: bedrock
model: us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6
region: us-west-2
personality: researcher
```

Omit `apiKey` — Bedrock authenticates every request with an AWS SigV4 signature, not a bearer key.

| Key | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provider` | Yes | — | `bedrock`. |
| `model` | Yes | — | The id from step 1, verbatim, including the trailing `:0` version suffix. |
| `region` | No | `us-east-1` | The Bedrock runtime endpoint region. There is no `AWS_REGION` fallback — set it here when you are not on `us-east-1`. |
| `awsProfile` | No | — | Named AWS profile for the credential chain. Ignored when static keys are configured. |

In a [fallback chain](configure-providers.md), `region` and `awsProfile` are per-entry too: `providers.0.region`, `providers.0.awsProfile`.

Static `accessKeyId` / `secretAccessKey` / `sessionToken` are deliberately **not** config keys. The secret store is the only supported home for them — see step 2, Option B.

### What the Bedrock provider supports

The Bedrock provider declares a narrower capability set than the same model reached through Anthropic directly. Check it before you move a production [personality](../../getting-started/glossary.md#personality) (a directory of files deciding an agent's tools, memory, and model) over.

| Capability | Bedrock provider | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Streaming | Yes | Tokens arrive incrementally, as on every other provider. |
| Tool calling | Yes | Personality toolsets work unchanged. |
| Prompt caching | No | Every turn re-sends the full prefix and is billed for it. The largest cost difference against `provider: anthropic`. |
| Extended thinking | No | A personality configured for thinking gets ordinary completions. |
| Vision — images | Yes | Image attachments reach the model. |
| Vision — documents | No | PDF and document attachments do not. |
| Token counting | Estimated | The usage line is an estimate, not a provider-reported count. |
| Context window | 200,000 tokens | Fixed by the provider. `contextWindow:` in `~/.ethos/config.yaml` is not read on this path. |

## Verify

Check the config, then run one turn:

```bash
ethos doctor
```

```
  ✓  Provider 'bedrock' is valid
```

```bash
ethos chat -q "respond with the single word 'ok'"
```

```
ok
```

A streamed `ok` means the model id, the credentials, and the IAM permission all resolved end-to-end.

To confirm *which* credential the chain picked, ask AWS with the same environment Ethos will run under:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

```json
{
    "UserId": "AROAEXAMPLEID:i-0123456789abcdef0",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/EthosInstanceRole/i-0123456789abcdef0"
}
```

An `assumed-role` ARN naming your instance, task, or service-account role confirms step 2 Option A is live.

## Troubleshoot

**`Bedrock has no accessKeyId/secretAccessKey configured, so requests are signed from the AWS default credential chain — and the chain could not resolve any credentials.`** — Every step of the chain came up empty. Resolution is lazy, so this surfaces on the first turn rather than at startup. Four fixes, by deployment:

1. **EC2** — attach an instance profile with the Bedrock policy.
2. **ECS** — set `taskRoleArn` on the task definition.
3. **EKS** — annotate the pod's service account with `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`.
4. **Laptop** — `aws sso login --profile <your-profile>`, then set `awsProfile: <your-profile>` in `~/.ethos/config.yaml` or export `AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>` in the shell that starts Ethos.

Confirm the fix with `aws sts get-caller-identity` before re-running `ethos chat`.

**`Bedrock has accessKeyId but no secretAccessKey. Static AWS credentials need both ...`** (or the same message with the two names swapped) — exactly one half of a static key pair resolved. Ethos refuses rather than falling through to the credential chain, because signing as a different AWS identity than you configured is worse than stopping. Either complete the pair at `providers/bedrock/accessKeyId` and `providers/bedrock/secretAccessKey`, or remove the half that is set so the chain takes over deliberately. Both halves absent is the intended zero-config path and is never an error.

**`Bedrock API error 403: ... is not authorized to perform: bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`.** — The identity resolved, but the policy does not cover this model. Check the `Resource` ARNs in step 3. A `us.`-prefixed inference profile needs both the inference-profile ARN and the foundation-model ARNs it routes to.

**`Bedrock API error 400: ... don't have access to the model with the specified model ID`.** — Model access is not granted for this model in the region `region:` names. Request it in the Bedrock console under **Model access**, in that region; approval for some models is not instant.

**The cost in the usage line does not match the AWS bill.** — Ethos prices a turn by substring-matching the model id against its own rate table. A Bedrock id carrying a known family name (`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-...` contains `claude-sonnet-4`) is priced at that family's public rate; an id with no match reports `$0.00` rather than a wrong number. Neither figure is read from Bedrock. AWS Cost Explorer is authoritative.
