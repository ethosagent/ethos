`~/.ethos/config.yaml` is a flat `key: value` file. Dotted keys (e.g. `retention.messages`, `providers.0.provider`) are how nested structures appear on disk — there is no indentation-based nesting. Inside double quotes exactly two escapes exist: `\\` is a backslash and `\"` is a quote. Every other backslash is literal, so `"C:\tmp"` and `"C:\Users\me"` read as written. Any other value, single-quoted included, is read with one quote stripped from each end. Ethos quotes a value only when it would not read back unchanged. Ethos refuses to write a value containing a newline, tab or other control character, and the error names the key — the file is line-based, so such a value could not be read back.

## Source {#source}

The full field set lives in the `EthosConfig` interface in [`packages/config/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/config/src/index.ts). `parseConfigYaml` reads values; `writeConfig` writes them. Fields marked `@internal` are managed by the runtime (e.g. `activeContext` by `ethos set`) — do not hand-edit them.

## Minimal example {#minimal-example}

```yaml
provider: anthropic
model: claude-opus-4-7
apiKey: sk-ant-...
personality: researcher
```

This is what `ethos setup` writes for a default Anthropic install. Everything below is optional.

## provider {#provider}

Type: string · Default: `anthropic` · Required (effectively)

LLM provider id. Resolved at wiring time against the registered provider list. Built-in values: `anthropic`, `openrouter`, `openai`, `ollama`, `gemini`. Custom values may resolve through plugins.

```yaml
provider: anthropic
```

## model {#model}

Type: string · Default: `claude-opus-4-7` · Required (effectively)

Model id to pass to the provider. Format depends on the provider — Anthropic uses raw model names, OpenRouter uses `vendor/model`.

```yaml
model: claude-opus-4-7
```

## apiKey {#api-key}

Type: string · Default: empty · Required

Primary provider API key. For multi-key rotation, leave this set to the most-trusted key and add fallbacks via `ethos keys add` (which writes `~/.ethos/keys.json`). The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env vars override this at wiring time when set.

```yaml
apiKey: sk-ant-...
```

## personality {#personality}

Type: string · Default: `researcher` · Required

Id of the default [personality](../../getting-started/glossary.md#personality). Built-ins: `researcher`, `engineer`, `reviewer`. System: `personality-architect`, `team-architect`. User personalities live under `~/.ethos/personalities/<id>/`.

```yaml
personality: engineer
```

## memory {#memory}

Type: `markdown` | `vector` | `vault` · Default: unset (treated as `markdown`)

Memory backend. One selection serves the agent, the web memory editor, the CLI memory verbs and the nightly pass:

- `markdown` — per-personality files under `~/.ethos/personalities/<id>/` (`MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`) (default).
- `vector` — SQLite + embeddings at `~/.ethos/memory.db`. No file editor: the web Memory page and `ethos memory restore|retract|supersede|history` refuse, because there are no files to edit.
- `vault` — the same file layout inside a directory you own (an Obsidian vault), set by [`memoryVault.path`](#memory-vault).

```yaml
memory: vault
memoryVault.path: /Users/you/Documents/Vault
```

Notes:

- Switching backends mid-stream does not migrate data — export from one, then import into the other.
- A change takes effect on restart. A running `ethos serve` / `ethos gateway` logs `memory backend changed — restart required to apply` and keeps the backend it booted with.
- Vector mode requires an embeddings-capable provider key.
- `ethos backup` does not archive vault content — see [Back up and restore](../how-to/back-up-and-restore.md#vault-memory).

## memoryVault.* {#memory-vault}

Read only when `memory: vault`.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `memoryVault.path` | string | — | Absolute path to the vault root. Required under `memory: vault`; boot fails without it. |
| `memoryVault.agentDir` | string | `Ethos` | Subtree of the vault the agent owns. Writes are confined to it; `search` may read the whole vault. |
| `memoryVault.prefetch` | comma list | `MEMORY.md, USER.md` | Keys injected into the prompt tail for a personality scope. |
| `memoryVault.exclude` | comma list | — | Names never read during `list()` / `search()`, on top of dot-directories and sync-conflict files. |

```yaml
memory: vault
memoryVault.path: /Users/you/Documents/Vault
memoryVault.agentDir: Ethos
memoryVault.prefetch: MEMORY.md, USER.md
memoryVault.exclude: Archive, Templates
```

Notes:

- Content lands in `<path>/<agentDir>/personalities/<id>/`; provenance history and diff blobs in `<path>/<agentDir>/.ethos-meta/` (dot-prefixed so Obsidian ignores it).
- The approval queue and its tombstones stay at `~/.ethos/` for every backend — they are gate state, not memory content.

## memoryApproval.* {#memory-approval}

Approve-before-store gate: a captured fact parks in a queue instead of being written, until someone approves it (`ethos memory pending`, or the web Memory page's Pending tab).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `memoryApproval.mode` | `off` \| `automated` \| `all` | `off` | `off` — writes go straight through; `automated` — gates writes the agent proposes on its own (capture, dream turns); `all` — gates every write, including explicit `memory_write` tool calls. |
| `memoryApproval.cap` | number | `200` | Per-scope queue ceiling. At cap the oldest candidate is dropped, logged, and reported as an observability event. |
| `memoryApproval.ttlDays` | number | `30` | Candidates older than this auto-REJECT (never auto-approve) and are tombstoned so capture does not re-propose them. |

```yaml
memoryApproval.mode: automated
memoryApproval.cap: 200
memoryApproval.ttlDays: 30
```

Notes:

- Cap and TTL apply to every queue over one deployment — the runtime gate, `ethos memory pending`, and the web Pending tab.
- A change takes effect on restart, like `memory` itself.

## baseUrl {#base-url}

Type: string · Default: provider default

Override the provider's API endpoint. Required for OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenRouter, Ollama, local proxies).

```yaml
baseUrl: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

## modelRouting.\<personality\> {#model-routing}

Type: string · Default: falls back to top-level `model`

Per-personality model override. The key is a personality id; the value is a model string for that personality's provider.

```yaml
modelRouting.researcher: claude-opus-4-7
modelRouting.engineer: moonshotai/kimi-k2.6
```

## providers.\<i\>.\* {#providers-chain}

Provider fallback chain. When two or more entries are present, the runtime wraps them in a `ChainedProvider` with cooldown-based failover. Index `0` is primary; higher indices fall back in order. With fewer than two entries, the top-level `provider` / `apiKey` / `model` fields are used instead. When Settings or `ethos fallback add` grows a chain from the top-level fields, entry `0` becomes the top-level provider, with the same key reference.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `providers.<i>.provider` | string | Provider id for entry `<i>`. |
| `providers.<i>.apiKey` | string | API key for entry `<i>`. |
| `providers.<i>.model` | string | Optional model override for entry `<i>`. |
| `providers.<i>.baseUrl` | string | Optional endpoint override for entry `<i>`. |
| `providers.<i>.apiVersion` | string | Azure only: REST API version for entry `<i>`. |
| `providers.<i>.region` | string | Bedrock only: AWS region for entry `<i>`. |
| `providers.<i>.awsProfile` | string | Bedrock only: named AWS profile for entry `<i>`. |
| `providers.<i>.serverCompaction` | boolean | Anthropic only. `true` lets the provider compact the conversation server-side instead of the local context engine. Default off. See [Server-side compaction](#server-compaction). |
| `providers.<i>.serverCompactionTriggerTokens` | integer | Input-token count at which the server compacts. Default: the local compaction threshold for the model. Values below 50,000 (the API minimum) are raised to 50,000. |

Any other `providers.<i>.<field>` line belongs to entry `<i>`: it moves with the entry when the chain is reordered and is removed with it. Its value is checked for plaintext credentials at boot like every other value. If one is found, Ethos refuses to start and names the line — run `ethos secrets set providers/<i>/<field> <value>`, then set the line to `providers.<i>.<field>: ${secrets:providers/<i>/<field>}`.

```yaml
providers.0.provider: anthropic
providers.0.apiKey: sk-ant-...
providers.0.model: claude-opus-4-7
providers.1.provider: openrouter
providers.1.apiKey: sk-or-...
providers.1.model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-7
```

### Server-side compaction {#server-compaction}

With `providers.<i>.serverCompaction: true` on an `anthropic` entry, Anthropic summarizes the older turns itself once a request's input reaches the trigger (the `compact_20260112` edit, beta `compact-2026-01-12`). The local context engine then stays out of the way for every turn that entry serves: the pre-request compaction, the overflow retry and the turn-end auto-compaction do not run, so a turn never compacts twice. The top-level spelling counts as entry `0`, so a single-provider setup turns it on with `providers.0.provider: anthropic` plus `providers.0.serverCompaction: true`.

- The trigger defaults to the threshold the local gate would compact at (`compaction.pressure` of the model's window, capped by `compaction.maxContextTokens`), so turning the switch on changes who compacts, not when.
- The summary block is saved in `sessions.db` as one extra assistant row and sent back on every later request, as the API requires.
- On any other provider the flag is ignored with a warning at startup.
- If the API refuses the edit (an unsupported model, for example), the request is retried once without it, an `audit.compaction` event with code `llm.server_compaction_rejected` lands in `observability.db`, and local compaction runs for the rest of that turn.
- After a failover to a non-Anthropic provider, the saved summary reaches it as plain assistant text; the encrypted half is Anthropic-only and is dropped.

```yaml
providers.0.provider: anthropic
providers.0.apiKey: ${secrets:providers/0/anthropic/apiKey}
providers.0.serverCompaction: true
providers.0.serverCompactionTriggerTokens: 150000
```

A compaction shows up as an assistant row that starts with the `\u001eethos:compaction\u001e` tag, and as an `llm.server_compacted` event. `ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug` prints each request body, where the next request carries the block back:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.ethos/sessions.db "SELECT role, substr(content, 1, 60) FROM messages WHERE content LIKE char(30) || 'ethos:compaction%';"
sqlite3 ~/.ethos/observability.db "SELECT code, cause FROM events WHERE code LIKE 'llm.server_compact%';"
```

## telegram.bots.\* {#telegram-bots}

Multi-bot list shape. When set, the gateway creates one `TelegramAdapter` and one `AgentLoop` per entry. `telegram.bots` takes precedence over the legacy `telegramToken` scalar when both are present.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `telegram.bots.<i>.token` | string | — | Bot token from BotFather. Required per entry. |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.id` | string | `sha256(token)[:24]` | Stable, human-readable bot key. Used in session lane names (`telegram:<botKey>:<chatId>`), log output, and the internal `Map<botKey, AgentLoop>`. Set once; do not change after the bot goes live. |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.bind.type` | `personality` \| `team` | — | Required. `personality` routes to a named personality. `team` routes to the team's coordinator personality and auto-starts the team supervisor. |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.bind.name` | string | — | Required. Personality id (for `personality`) or team name (for `team`). |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.bind.allowSlashSwitch` | boolean | `false` | Allow per-chat `/personality` switching. Disabled by default for identity-bound bots. In a group chat only `channel_filter.telegram.ownerUserId` may switch; a group with no owner configured refuses. |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.defaultChannelMode` | `mention_only` \| `thread_follow` \| `all` \| `regex_match` \| `observe` | `mention_only` | Reply-and-record behaviour in group chats that have no per-chat override. Five values — one more than Slack's four; see the mode list below. Every value except `mention_only` acts on group messages nobody addressed to the bot, and Telegram delivers those only when BotFather's Group Privacy is off — see [Platform prerequisites for group messages](../../platforms/telegram.md#3b-platform-prerequisites-for-group-messages). An out-of-range value is a parse error, not a silent fallback. |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.useWebhook` | boolean | `false` | Receive updates over an inbound webhook instead of long-polling. Requires `webhookUrl` and `webhookSecretToken` — the adapter throws at startup without either. See [Receive Slack and Telegram events over webhooks](../how-to/run-channels-over-webhooks.md). |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.webhookUrl` | string | — | Required when `useWebhook` is `true`. The full public URL Telegram POSTs updates to, **including** the `/telegram/webhook/<botKey>` path — the host routes on that path, so a URL without it reaches no handler. Registered for you by `setWebhook()` at startup. |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.webhookSecretToken` | string | — | Required when `useWebhook` is `true`. Echoed by Telegram in `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` and compared by grammy before the update is processed. A credential: externalized to the secret vault exactly like `token`, so write it as `${secrets:<ref>}`. |
| `telegram.bots.<i>.dropPendingUpdates` | boolean | `true` | Discard updates Telegram queued while the process was down. **Poll mode only** — `bot.start()` is never called for a webhook-mode bot, so the flag does nothing there. Set `false` on a poll-mode bot in a deployment that sleeps and wakes, so a restart does not wipe the backlog. |

```yaml
telegram.bots.0.token: "123456:ABCdefGhIJklmNopQRstuVwxYZ"
telegram.bots.0.id: researcher-bot
telegram.bots.0.bind.type: personality
telegram.bots.0.bind.name: researcher

telegram.bots.1.token: "654321:XYZabcDeFgHijKlMnOpqRsTuV"
telegram.bots.1.id: coder-bot
telegram.bots.1.bind.type: personality
telegram.bots.1.bind.name: engineer
```

Notes:

- `defaultChannelMode` values, as `evaluateChannelMode()` in [`packages/core/src/channel-mode.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/core/src/channel-mode.ts) resolves them:
  - `mention_only` — reply only when the message contains the bot's `@username` (default).
  - `thread_follow` — `mention_only`, plus every message in a forum topic the bot has already posted in.
  - `all` — reply to every message in the chat.
  - `regex_match` — `mention_only`, plus messages matching a per-chat stored pattern. **No effect as a global default:** the pattern is read from a per-chat override, and Telegram has no way to write one yet (see the bullet below), so a message that is not a mention never matches.
  - `observe` — record every message to the channel transcript and reply to none of them, not even an explicit `@mention`. Direct messages to the bot are answered under every mode, `observe` included.
  - **An unrecognised mode fails closed — not answered, not recorded.** It cannot reach the evaluator from this key (an out-of-range value here is a parse error, per the table above), but it can from the per-chat override store on disk — a hand-edited entry, or a mode written by a newer build and read by an older one. `evaluateChannelMode()` drops those before every other test rather than falling back to `mention_only`; the affected chat goes silent. Direct messages are still answered, which is the channel left to notice it through.
- **Per-chat overrides cannot be set on Telegram yet.** The adapter reads a per-chat override store (`ChannelOverrideStore`, JSONL under the bot's `telegram/<botKey>/` directory) and a stored entry wins over this key, but no command or API writes one — Slack's `/ethos channel-mode` has no Telegram equivalent. This key is the only way to put a Telegram chat into `observe` today, and it applies to every group the bot is in.
- A bot whose resolved mode is `observe` while BotFather's Group Privacy is still on records nothing at all. The adapter checks `getMe` at startup and logs `Telegram privacy mode is ON for @<username> — chats set to observe will record nothing.` rather than leaving an empty transcript to explain itself.
- Session key format in multi-bot mode: `telegram:<botKey>:<chatId>`. This differs from single-bot mode (`telegram:<chatId>`).
- `deriveBotKey()` in [`packages/config/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/config/src/index.ts) computes the sha256-derived default when `id` is omitted.
- See [Run multiple Telegram bots from one process](../how-to/run-multi-bot-telegram.md) for a full walkthrough.

## telegramToken {#telegram-token}

Type: string · Default: unset · **Deprecated** (use `telegram.bots` instead)

Legacy scalar shape — wires one bot bound to the default `personality`. Still supported; creates a single-element entry in the gateway's internal bot list. When both `telegramToken` and `telegram.bots` are set, `telegram.bots` takes precedence and this field is ignored with a deprecation warning.

```yaml
telegramToken: 123456:ABC-DEF...
```

## slack.apps.\* {#slack-apps}

Multi-app list shape for Slack. Each entry creates one Slack adapter bound to a personality or team. Supersedes the legacy scalar fields `slackBotToken`, `slackAppToken`, and `slackSigningSecret` when set.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `slack.apps.<i>.botToken` | string | — | `xoxb-` bot token. Required per entry. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.appToken` | string | — | `xapp-` app-level token for Socket Mode. Required only while `mode.socket` is in effect (the default); an HTTP-mode app has no Socket Mode connection and needs none. The adapter throws when `mode.socket` is on and this is absent. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.signingSecret` | string | — | Signing secret from the app's Basic Information page. Required per entry. Exercised only under `mode.http`, where it is the HMAC key every inbound Events API request is verified against; under Socket Mode it is carried but never used — the socket is authenticated by `appToken` and receives no HTTP requests to verify. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.mode.socket` | boolean | `true` | Connect over Socket Mode (WebSocket). Mutually exclusive with `mode.http` — the adapter throws when both are `true`, because they are two transports for the same inbound event stream. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.mode.http` | boolean | `false` | Receive Events API deliveries over inbound HTTP instead. Requires `signingSecret`, and requires setting `mode.socket: false` explicitly. Slack has no registration API: you must set the Event Subscriptions Request URL in the Slack app dashboard yourself. See [Receive Slack and Telegram events over webhooks](../how-to/run-channels-over-webhooks.md). |
| `slack.apps.<i>.webhookPath` | string | the app's `botKey` | Route segment this app's HTTP receiver answers on, under `/slack/events/`. HTTP mode only. Leading and trailing slashes are stripped. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.id` | string | `sha256(botToken)[:24]` | Stable, human-readable app key. Used in session lane names and log output. Set once; do not change after the app goes live. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.bind.type` | `personality` \| `team` | — | Required. Same semantics as the Telegram equivalent. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.bind.name` | string | — | Required. Personality id or team name. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.bind.allowSlashSwitch` | boolean | `false` | Allow per-channel `/personality` switching. In a channel only `channel_filter.slack.ownerUserId` may switch; a channel with no owner configured refuses. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.defaultChannelMode` | `mention_only` \| `thread_follow` \| `all` \| `observe` | `mention_only` | Reply-and-record behaviour in channels that have no per-channel override. Four values, not Telegram's five — the Slack adapter has no `regex_match`. `thread_follow` also answers follow-ups in threads the bot has already posted in; `all` answers every message; `observe` records every message and replies to none, not even an explicit `@mention`. DMs are answered under every mode. Anything but `mention_only` needs the `message.channels` / `message.groups` event subscriptions — see [Platform prerequisites for unaddressed channel messages](../../platforms/slack.md#1a-platform-prerequisites-for-unaddressed-channel-messages). `/ethos channel-mode <mode>` overrides it per channel. An out-of-range value is a parse error, not a silent fallback. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.receiptReaction` | string | `eyes` | Emoji name (no colons) reacted onto an inbound message on arrival and removed once the reply lands. Needs the `reactions:write` scope; without it the reaction is skipped silently. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.allowedSlashUsers` | string list | unset | Comma-separated Slack user ids allowed to run `/ethos` and to see the App Home tab's memory, session, kanban, and channel sections. Narrows `channel_filter.slack` (`ownerUserId` + `recipientAllowlist`) — an id listed here that is not on that allowlist stays denied. Absent or empty means the `channel_filter.slack` allowlist alone. Both empty means nobody: the gate is default-closed. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.allowedBotIds` | string list | unset | Comma-separated Slack `bot_id`s whose messages reach the agent, in new posts, edits, and thread backfill alike. Absent or empty drops every bot- and workflow-authored message — the gate is default-closed. Read a bot's id from the `bot_id` field of any message it has posted. |
| `slack.apps.<i>.longReplyThresholdChars` | integer | `9000` | Reply length above which the agent posts a short lead message ending in "full answer attached" plus the complete text as an `answer.md` upload, instead of four or more chunked messages. `0` disables the fallback. The upload needs the `files:write` scope; without it the reply falls back to the chunked messages. |

```yaml
slack.apps.0.botToken: "xoxb-..."
slack.apps.0.appToken: "xapp-..."
slack.apps.0.signingSecret: "abc123..."
slack.apps.0.id: eng-slack
slack.apps.0.bind.type: team
slack.apps.0.bind.name: eng
slack.apps.0.allowedBotIds: B01DEPLOYBOT,B02ALERTBOT
```

Notes:

- `/ethos` and the App Home tab are default-deny as of this release, and the trust set comes from `channel_filter.slack` — the same allowlist that decides who may message the bot. A workspace with no `channel_filter.slack.ownerUserId` and no `recipientAllowlist` authorizes nobody: every `/ethos` invocation answers "You are not authorized to use this command," and App Home shows a notice in place of its private sections. **This is a breaking change** — before it, any workspace member could run `/ethos memory add`, which writes the bound personality's `MEMORY.md` into every later system prompt. Set `channel_filter.slack.ownerUserId` to your Slack user id to restore access. `channel_filter.slack.enabled: false` does not reopen these surfaces; it only disables the message filter.
- An allowlisted bot's message carries `userId = <bot_id>`, and the gateway's channel filter allowlists by `userId`. Two gates guard a bot message and both must open: `allowedBotIds` here, plus the same `bot_id` in `channelFilter.slack.recipientAllowlist` (or no filter configured at all). See [Run an agent on Slack](../../platforms/slack.md) for the filter block. There is no bypass — an operator who opens one gate and forgets the other sees the bot's messages silently dropped at the gateway.
- The same two gates apply to the bot's lines in **thread backfill**, and only under `channel_filter.slack.contextVisibility: allowlist`. Backfilled history is attributed line by line, and each line is checked against `recipientAllowlist` by the same id — a human's Slack user id, a bot's `bot_id`. So an operator running the stricter context-visibility setting who allowlists a bot in `allowedBotIds` but not in `recipientAllowlist` sees its history lines dropped while its live messages are dropped too, consistently. Under the default `contextVisibility: all`, backfill is not filtered at all and `allowedBotIds` alone decides which bots appear in it.

## teams.\* {#teams}

Per-team runtime knobs. These apply to teams that the gateway auto-starts via `bind.type: team` in `telegram.bots` or `slack.apps`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `teams.<name>.autoStop` | boolean | `true` | When `true`, the gateway stops the team supervisor when the gateway shuts down. Set to `false` to leave the supervisor running across gateway restarts. |

```yaml
teams.eng.autoStop: false
```

Notes:

- `<name>` must match the team manifest filename stem at `~/.ethos/teams/<name>.yaml`.
- With `autoStop: false`, stop the supervisor manually with `ethos team stop <name>`.
- See [Connect a Telegram bot to a team](../how-to/connect-telegram-to-team.md) for a usage example.

## discordToken {#discord-token}

Type: string · Default: unset

Bot token for the Discord gateway.

## discord.defaultChannelMode {#discord-default-channel-mode}

Type: `mention_only` | `thread_follow` | `all` | `observe` · Default: `mention_only`

Reply-and-record behaviour in every guild channel that has no per-channel override. Discord is single-bot — its credential is the top-level [`discordToken`](#discord-token) scalar, with no `discord.bots` roster — so this is a **top-level** key, not an indexed entry like [`telegram.bots.<i>.defaultChannelMode`](#telegram-bots) or [`slack.apps.<i>.defaultChannelMode`](#slack-apps).

- `mention_only` — reply only when the message `@mentions` the bot (default).
- `thread_follow` — `mention_only`, plus every message in a thread the bot has already posted in.
- `all` — reply to every message in the channel.
- `observe` — record every message to the channel transcript and reply to none of them, not even an explicit `@mention`.
- **An unrecognised mode fails closed — not answered, not recorded.** Not reachable from this key, which is validated at parse (below), but reachable from a per-channel override written by hand or by a newer build. `evaluateChannelMode()` drops those before every other test rather than falling back to `mention_only`. Direct messages are still answered.

```yaml
discord.defaultChannelMode: observe
```

Notes:

- Four values, not Telegram's five — the Discord adapter has no `regex_match`. DMs are answered under every mode, `observe` included. An out-of-range value is a parse error, not a silent fallback: `ethos gateway` and `ethos boot` print `discord: invalid defaultChannelMode '<value>'` and exit non-zero.
- Read once at gateway startup. Restart the gateway after editing.
- Unlike Slack and Telegram, Discord needs no extra platform-side switch for messages nobody addressed to the bot. The **Message Content Intent** the adapter already requires for mentions covers them too — see [Confirm intents](../../platforms/discord.md#3-confirm-intents).
- **Per-channel overrides cannot be set on Discord.** The adapter reads a per-channel override store (`ChannelOverrideStore`, JSONL under `~/.ethos/discord/<botKey>/`) and a stored entry wins over this key, but no command or API writes one — Slack's `/ethos channel-mode` has no Discord equivalent. This key is the only way to put a Discord channel into `observe` today, and it applies to every channel the bot can see. `/ethos help` prints the channel's effective mode.

## slackBotToken {#slack-bot-token}

Type: string · Default: unset

`xoxb-` bot token for the Slack gateway. Required together with `slackAppToken` and `slackSigningSecret` for Slack to bind.

```yaml
slackBotToken: xoxb-...
slackAppToken: xapp-...
slackSigningSecret: ...
```

## slackAppToken {#slack-app-token}

Type: string · Default: unset

`xapp-` app-level token for Slack Socket Mode. See [`slackBotToken`](#slack-bot-token) for the example.

## slackSigningSecret {#slack-signing-secret}

Type: string · Default: unset

Slack request signing secret. Verifies inbound webhooks when running Slack in HTTP mode.

## whatsapp.\<i\>.default_mode {#whatsapp-default-mode}

Type: `all` | `mention_only` | `observe` · Default: `mention_only`

Reply-and-record behaviour in the group chats of the WhatsApp account at index `<i>` that have no per-chat override. Note the key name: `default_mode`, snake_case — not `defaultChannelMode`. The whole `whatsapp.<i>.*` block is snake_case (`session_dir`, `allowed_numbers`, `phone_number`), and this key follows its own block rather than the other three platforms. It is the real key, not a typo.

- `all` — reply to every message in the group.
- `mention_only` — reply only when the message mentions the bot (default).
- `observe` — record every message to the channel transcript and reply to none of them, not even an explicit mention.

```yaml
whatsapp.0.default_mode: observe
```

Notes:

- Three values — the smallest of the four adapters' sets. WhatsApp has no threads, so no `thread_follow`, and no `regex_match`. Direct chats are answered under every mode, `observe` included. An out-of-range value is a parse error, not a silent fallback: `ethos gateway` and `ethos boot` print `whatsapp[<i>]: invalid default_mode '<value>'` and exit non-zero.
- Read once at gateway startup. Restart the gateway after editing.
- **The adapter's own fallback is `all`, not `mention_only`.** `DEFAULT_CHANNEL_MODE` in [`extensions/platform-whatsapp/src/config.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/extensions/platform-whatsapp/src/config.ts) is `all`, because an unset mode has always meant "answer every group message" for code that constructs `WhatsAppAdapter` directly and flipping it would silence a working embedder on upgrade. The gateway never leaves it unset — it passes `default_mode ?? 'mention_only'` — so an `ethos gateway` deployment gets `mention_only` like every other platform. The `all` fallback is reachable only by embedding the adapter yourself.
- **Per-chat overrides cannot be set on WhatsApp.** The adapter reads a per-chat override store (`ChannelOverrideStore`, JSONL under `~/.ethos/whatsapp/<botKey>/`) and a stored entry wins over this key, but no command or API writes one — Slack's `/ethos channel-mode` has no WhatsApp equivalent. This key is the only way to put a WhatsApp group into `observe` today, and it applies to every group that account is in.

## emailImapHost {#email-imap-host}

Type: string · Default: unset

IMAP server hostname for the email gateway. The email block requires all six of `emailImapHost`, `emailImapPort`, `emailUser`, `emailPassword`, `emailSmtpHost`, `emailSmtpPort` to bind.

```yaml
emailImapHost: imap.gmail.com
emailImapPort: 993
emailUser: you@example.com
emailPassword: ...
emailSmtpHost: smtp.gmail.com
emailSmtpPort: 587
```

## emailImapPort {#email-imap-port}

Type: integer · Default: unset

IMAP server port. Conventional values: `993` (TLS), `143` (STARTTLS).

## emailUser {#email-user}

Type: string · Default: unset

Mailbox username — typically the full email address.

## emailPassword {#email-password}

Type: string · Default: unset

Mailbox password. Use an app-specific password where the provider supports it (Gmail, Fastmail).

## emailSmtpHost {#email-smtp-host}

Type: string · Default: unset

SMTP server hostname for outbound mail.

## emailSmtpPort {#email-smtp-port}

Type: integer · Default: unset

SMTP server port. Conventional values: `587` (STARTTLS), `465` (TLS).

## emailTrustedAuthservId {#email-trusted-authserv-id}

Type: string · Default: unset

The authserv-id your mailbox's own receiving mail server stamps on incoming mail: the first token of its `Authentication-Results` header (RFC 8601). The email gateway treats a sender's `From:` address as their identity only when the topmost `Authentication-Results` header carrying this id reports `dmarc=pass` with `header.from` equal to the `From:` domain, or `dkim=pass` with `header.d` equal to, or a parent of, that domain. Every other header is ignored. Enforced by `resolveEmailSender` in [`extensions/platform-email/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/extensions/platform-email/src/index.ts).

```yaml
emailTrustedAuthservId: mx.google.com
```

Notes:

- **Unset means every sender is unverified.** An unverified sender gets the user id `email-unverified:<sha256 of the lowercased address>` instead of their address. That id is stable per address and cannot equal a verified user's id, so it never inherits that user's memory, `channel_filter` owner status or approvals. The message reaches the personality with a one-line `[unverified sender]` notice in front of it, and runs in its own session rather than the verified sender's. Replies still go to the `From:` address.
- To find the value, open the raw source of any mail this account received and read the first word after `Authentication-Results:`. On Gmail that is `mx.google.com`. The comparison ignores case.
- `ethos gateway start` and `ethos boot` record one warn-level observability event (`email.sender_auth_unconfigured`) and print one console line at startup when email is configured without this key.
- A header the parser cannot read, found above the trusted one, makes the sender unverified. So do more than one `From:` header, and an explicit non-pass `dmarc` result, even when `dkim` passed.

## web.host, web.port, web.corsOrigins {#web-server}

Type: dotted group · Default: per-field below

Bind address, port, and CORS origins for the `ethos serve` web API — the process that mounts `/v1/*` and `/rpc/*`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web.host` | string | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Precedence: `--web-host` CLI flag > `ETHOS_WEB_HOST` env var > this key > default. |
| `web.port` | integer | `3000` | Listen port. Precedence: `--web-port` CLI flag > `ETHOS_WEB_PORT` env var > this key > default. |
| `web.corsOrigins` | string | unset (no CORS) | Comma-separated origins (or `*`) allowed to call `/v1/*` directly from a browser. No CLI flag exists for this one. Precedence: `ETHOS_API_CORS_ORIGINS` env var > this key > default (unset). |

```yaml
web.host: 0.0.0.0
web.port: 3000
web.corsOrigins: "https://chat.example.com"
```

Notes:

- See [Serve Ethos as an OpenAI-compatible backend](../../building/how-to/openai-server-chat.md#1-boot-the-server) for these keys in practice, including the CORS caveat for server-side clients.

## verbose {#verbose}

Type: boolean · Default: `false`

Print a per-turn timing summary (LLM time, TTFT, tool wall-clock, tokens, cost) after every chat response.

```yaml
verbose: true
```

Notes:

- Toggle within a session with [`/verbose`](./slash-commands.md#slash-verbose) — that override is session-local and never written here.

## skin {#skin}

Type: string · Default: engine default

Named [skin](../../getting-started/glossary.md#skin) override. Built-in values: `default`, `mono`, `paper`. Applies across the TUI and the web `ConfigProvider`. This is the only place a skin is set — a personality is an identity, not a theme, so personalities carry no `skin` field.

```yaml
skin: mono
```

## retention.* {#retention}

Per-category TTLs for the observability store and the observe-mode channel transcript. Unset fields fall back to the runtime defaults shown below.

**Duration grammar:** `forever`, or a whole number followed by `d` (days), `w` (weeks), `m` (months, 30 days) or `y` (years, 365 days) — `30d`, `12w`, `6m`, `2y`. **Hours and minutes are not in the grammar**; `12h` is not a retention value. A value outside the grammar is dropped at load with a warning naming the key, and the category prunes on its default window instead. `ethos doctor` prints that warning, as do `ethos serve`, `ethos gateway` and `ethos boot` at startup.

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `retention.messages` | `365d` | Conversation message history. |
| `retention.traces` | `90d` | Turn traces. |
| `retention.spans` | `90d` | Tool / LLM spans inside traces. |
| `retention.blobs` | `7d` | Large response payloads stored out-of-band. |
| `retention.archive` | `730d` | Archive partitions. |
| `retention.channelTranscript` | `30d` | Third-party group-chat text recorded verbatim by an [observe-mode](#telegram-bots) channel, in `~/.ethos/channel-transcript.db`. Pruned against when Ethos saw the message, not when the platform says it was sent, so a backdated message cannot outlive the window. Short by design: the corpus grows with the room's traffic rather than with your use of the agent, and only the last digest window is ever read. |
| `retention.events.error` | `90d` | Error events from `errors.jsonl`. |
| `retention.events.audit` | `365d` | Audit events (key rotation, personality writes, approvals). |
| `retention.events.channel` | `365d` | Channel-adapter events (pairing, dedup). |
| `retention.events.install` | `forever` | Install / migration events. Never deleted by default. |

```yaml
retention.messages: 365d
retention.traces: 90d
retention.channelTranscript: 7d
retention.events.error: 90d
retention.events.install: forever
```

Notes:

- **A per-personality window for `retention.channelTranscript` prunes nothing, and is refused.** Observe-mode transcripts live in one `~/.ethos/channel-transcript.db` with no personality column, and the nightly job reads the global `retention.channelTranscript` only. Both setters refuse the combination and name the reason: `ethos retention set channelTranscript <duration> --personality <id>`, and the web Settings page — where the Personality column offers only `Global` for this subkey, and a save carrying one is rejected before it is written. Set the global key instead. A value an earlier build stored is still cleared the usual way: `ethos retention reset channelTranscript --personality <id>`, or removing the row in Settings and saving.
- **Pruning runs once a night, at 03:00 local time, and a missed run is not made up.** All retention categories are aged out by a single system cron job (`observability-prune`) on a fixed `0 3 * * *` schedule that no config key changes. That job is created with `missedRunPolicy: skip`, so a machine that was asleep or powered off at 03:00 rolls the run forward rather than executing it late — a laptop that is never awake at 03:00 never prunes anything, indefinitely and silently. There is no prune at startup. Run Ethos on a machine that is up at 03:00 if a window here matters to you.
- **`ethos data prune` does not cover `retention.channelTranscript`.** It prunes the observability store only. The channel transcript is a separate database with no manual prune command; the nightly job is the only thing that ages it out.
- **Per-message audit events outlive the transcript text they describe.** Every message an observe-mode channel records also emits a `channel.observed` audit event carrying the platform, chat id and sender id — no message text, but a durable record of who spoke where and when. That event is in the `audit` category (`365d`) and in a different database, so it survives the transcript's `30d` window by roughly 12×. Lowering `retention.channelTranscript` does not lower it; set `retention.events.audit` too if that matters to you.

## personalities.\<id\>.retention.* {#personalities-retention}

Per-personality retention overrides. Same sub-fields as the top-level `retention.*` block; values apply only to data tagged with the matching personality id.

```yaml
personalities.engineer-paired.retention.messages: 730d
personalities.engineer-paired.retention.traces: 180d
```

Notes:

- Only the `retention` sub-block is parsed under `personalities.<id>.*`. Other top-level keys cannot be overridden per personality from this file — set them in the personality's own `config.yaml`.
- **No category honours a per-personality window on the nightly prune today.** `personalities.<id>.retention.*` is read by `ethos retention show --personality <id>` and by `ethos data prune --personality <id>` (which prunes on demand, against the merged window). The scheduled `observability-prune` job reads the global `retention.*` block only, so a value set here shortens nothing on its own.

## channelDigest.* {#channel-digest}

Type: object · Default: off

The scheduled summary of what [`observe`-mode](#telegram-bots) channels recorded. One digest per lane — a lane is a chat *and* a thread — delivered to the owner's DM from the bot that watched it, plus the in-app notifications feed. Nothing is ever posted back into the observed room.

Off unless `enabled: true`. Seeded only by `ethos gateway start` and `ethos boot`; `ethos serve` runs no channel adapters and creates no job.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `channelDigest.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Create the `channel-digest` cron job. Any value other than the literal `true` reads as `false`. |
| `channelDigest.cron` | cron expression | `0 8 * * *` | When the digest runs, in the host's local time. |
| `channelDigest.deliverTo` | `owner` \| `inApp` | `owner` | `owner` — the owner's DM *and* the in-app feed. `inApp` — the feed only. The feed always gets a copy, so this names the delivery that can be switched off, not a choice between two. Any other value is a parse error. |
| `channelDigest.maxMessagesPerLane` | integer ≥ 1 | `500` | Messages read per lane per run. The oldest undigested ones are taken first; the rest are counted, reported in the digest's footnote, and read by the next run. A whole-string check — `500 messages` is a parse error, not `500`. |
| `channelDigest.maxLanesPerRun` | integer ≥ 1 | `25` | Lanes one run may send to the model. A real ceiling: it binds before any money is spent. Lanes past it are deferred with their cursors untouched, so nothing is lost — one watched Slack channel with 80 threads in a day is otherwise 80 model calls and 80 direct messages from one nightly run. |
| `channelDigest.costWarnUsdPerLane` | number > 0 | `0.5` | Spend **notice** threshold for one lane, in USD. Not a ceiling — a digest is a single model call that reports its cost after billing, so a lane that costs more is still delivered, with a footnote saying what it cost. |

```yaml
channelDigest.enabled: true
channelDigest.cron: 0 8 * * *
channelDigest.deliverTo: owner
channelDigest.maxLanesPerRun: 25
```

Notes:

- **Owner delivery needs `channel_filter.<platform>.ownerUserId`.** A platform with no owner id has nowhere to send its digests: each lane is counted undelivered, its cursor is left alone, and a `channel.digest_undelivered` event says why. The in-app copy still goes out.
- **An owner id that names a watched chat is refused.** `ownerUserId` is a bare platform id, and on Telegram or WhatsApp nothing in it distinguishes a DM from a group — so a value copied from an observed chat would post the summary into a room it is about, in front of the people it is about. Any observed chat on that platform is refused, not just the lane being summarised.
- **`deliverTo: inApp` under `ethos gateway` refuses to start.** Only `ethos boot` serves the web UI that the feed reaches, so under `ethos gateway` every digest would be generated and discarded. The error names both fixes.
- **Delivery is what consumes a lane.** A cursor advances only on a confirmed delivery, so a failed send, a missing owner, a refused owner or a crash mid-run all leave the messages to be digested again. Duplicates are possible by design; a lost digest is not.
- **The digest turn gets no tools, no memory, no session and no plugin hooks.** It is a bare model call, not an agent turn — the one place in the system where unfiltered third-party text meets a model. See [Security controls](../../security/controls.md).
- **Two runs on one machine cannot overlap.** A run holds `~/.ethos/channel-digest.lock` for its whole duration; a second run on the same host skips rather than waiting, names the process holding the lock in its run output, and records a `channel.digest_skipped` event. A restart overlapping its predecessor is covered. An `ethos gateway start` beside an `ethos boot` never gets that far: both take the gateway lock, and the second exits `3`. **The guarantee stops at the host boundary.** The lock identifies its holder by process id and boot id, both facts about the local machine, so a lock written by another host can read as abandoned and be taken over rather than respected — two machines sharing one `~/.ethos` over a network mount do not exclude each other. Both then send the same rooms to the model, deliver the same digest to the same owner, and the later write erases the cursors the earlier one advanced. Run one gateway per `~/.ethos`.

## logs.rotation {#logs-rotation}

Type: object · Default: `{ maxBytes: 10485760, maxFiles: 5, enabled: true }`

Controls rotation of `~/.ethos/logs/errors.jsonl`. When the file exceeds `maxBytes`, it is renamed to `errors.jsonl.1` and older backups shift up to `maxFiles`.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `logs.rotation.maxBytes` | integer | `10485760` (10 MiB) | Maximum file size before rotation. Must be a positive integer. |
| `logs.rotation.maxFiles` | integer | `5` | Maximum number of rotated backup files. Must be a positive integer. |
| `logs.rotation.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Set to `false` to disable rotation entirely. |

```yaml
logs.rotation.maxBytes: 20971520
logs.rotation.maxFiles: 10
logs.rotation.enabled: true
```

## backup.* {#backup}

Scheduled local snapshots of `~/.ethos/`. On by default: a serving process (`ethos serve`, `ethos gateway start`, `ethos boot`) seeds a `backup` cron job at first start and writes an `identity,state` archive at 04:00 local every night, keeping the newest seven. Nothing here uploads anywhere — the archive stays on this machine.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backup.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Set to `false` to remove the scheduled job. Any value other than the literal `true` reads as `false`; the job is created, rescheduled, or removed to match on every serving-process start. |
| `backup.cron` | cron expression | `0 4 * * *` | When the scheduled backup fires, in the host's local time. Editing it patches the existing job rather than creating a second one. |
| `backup.scope` | comma-separated list | `identity,state` | Which scopes the scheduled run archives. Values: `identity` — config, `mcp.json`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, `cron/jobs.json`, `personalities/`; `state` — the durable databases plus `skills/`, `teams/`, `users/`, `digests/`, `cron/output/` and plugin pins; `telemetry` — `observability.db`, opt-in. An unknown name fails that backup run, naming it, and leaves the other system jobs alone. |
| `backup.keep` | integer ≥ 1 | `7` | How many scheduled archives survive rotation, oldest deleted first. A non-integer or `0` is a config parse error. Rotation only ever deletes files named `ethos-scheduled-<timestamp>.tar.gz` — a manual `ethos backup` archive parked in the same directory is never swept up. |
| `backup.dir` | path | `<ethosDir>/backups` | Where archives are written and rotated. A relative value resolves under the data directory, not the process working directory. |

```yaml
backup.enabled: true
backup.cron: 0 4 * * *
backup.scope: identity,state
backup.keep: 7
backup.dir: /mnt/snapshots/ethos
```

Notes:

- `${ETHOS_HOME}` is not a token this file expands. The `<ethosDir>/backups` default is computed in code by `backupDirectory` in [`packages/wiring/src/backup-schedule.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/wiring/src/backup-schedule.ts); write a literal path if you want one.
- The schedule only fires while a serving process is running. `ethos chat` alone runs no cron.
- A `state` archive holds conversation history — sessions, session cards, memory. Treat the backup directory as sensitive as `~/.ethos/` itself.
- Secrets are never archived. `secrets/`, `keys.json`, `web-token` and MCP OAuth token files are excluded; the archive lists what is missing so a restore can prompt for it.
- See [Back up and restore an Ethos install](../how-to/back-up-and-restore.md) for these keys in practice, and [`ethos backup`](./cli.md#ethos-backup) for the manual command.

## security.trusted_github_orgs {#security-trusted-github-orgs}

Type: comma-separated list · Default: `ethosagent, anthropic`

The GitHub organizations whose skills and plugins install at the `trusted-repo` trust tier. Everything else on `github.com` installs at `community`. The value **replaces** the default list rather than extending it, so removing an organization you do not trust — including either shipped default — is expressible. Matching is exact on the organization path segment; `github.com/ethosagent-evil/x` does not match `ethosagent`, and any path containing `.` or `..` is refused outright.

```yaml
security.trusted_github_orgs: acme-corp, ethosagent
```

An explicitly empty value trusts no organization. It is a real setting, not the same as leaving the key out — an absent key keeps the shipped default in force.

```yaml
security.trusted_github_orgs: ""
```

Notes:

- `trusted-repo` lets an operator force past a red scanner finding with `--force`. It does **not** silently accept yellow findings — only `builtin` (code shipped inside Ethos itself) does that. Adding an organization here grants an override lever, not a scan bypass.
- Organization names are case-sensitive here. Write the organization exactly as it appears in the `github.com/<org>/<repo>` path.
- The list is read at the composition root and passed into the scanner. Defined in [`packages/safety/scanner/src/trust-tiers.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/safety/scanner/src/trust-tiers.ts).

## learningReplay.* {#learning-replay}

Type: object · Default: every field at its default below · Required: no

Settings for the replay that measures a learned skill or Expression change against frozen past tasks before it can go live. Absent keys take `LEARNING_REPLAY_DEFAULTS`, applied by `resolveLearningReplay` in [`packages/config/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/config/src/index.ts). Every number is validated as the whole string, so a value with trailing text (`8 cases`, `0.5usd`) is a parse error, not the leading number.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `learningReplay.enabled` | boolean | `true` | `false` stops replay running at all: the nightly pass skips its `replay` step and `ethos learning replay <id>` refuses with `replay_unavailable`. It does not let anything go live unmeasured. A candidate with no verdict is never auto-promoted, so every candidate waits for a human, who must give a reason to approve it. Any value other than the literal `true` reads as `false`. |
| `learningReplay.maxCases` | integer ≥ 3 | `8` | Cases replayed per candidate, at most 3 of them target cases. A value below 3 is a parse error: a replay of fewer than 3 cases can never reach a `pass` verdict. Values above 8 are clamped to 8 (`MAX_REPLAY_CASES`, `extensions/learning-inbox/src/replay.ts`). |
| `learningReplay.maxCostUsd` | number > 0 | `0.50` | Replay-loop spend per candidate, in USD. A run that crosses it stops and scores `incomplete`, so the candidate cannot auto-promote. Written as digits with an optional decimal part (`0.5`, `2`). Grader calls are not counted against it. |
| `learningReplay.maxCandidatesPerRun` | integer ≥ 1 | `5` | Candidates one nightly run replays, across all personalities together, oldest first. The rest wait for the next run. |

```yaml
learningReplay.enabled: true
learningReplay.maxCases: 8
learningReplay.maxCostUsd: 0.50
learningReplay.maxCandidatesPerRun: 5
```

Notes:

- Replay measures approach, not answers. Tools are stubbed in a dry run, so a replay scores tool choice, arguments, voice and approach, but not whether an answer that depends on real tool output got better. A `pass` is not proof the change improved answers.
- Replay runs real models and costs money on every candidate it measures, for both the baseline arm and the candidate arm.
- See [Why does a learned change need a replay before it goes live?](../explanation/learning-inbox.md) for the verdict rules and when a `pass` promotes on its own.

## nightlyPass.* {#nightly-pass}

Type: object · Default: off · Required: no

The scheduled nightly learning pass. When enabled, a serving process (`ethos serve`, `ethos gateway start`, `ethos boot`) creates a `nightly-pass` cron job (`systemJobSpecs`, [`packages/wiring/src/system-jobs.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/wiring/src/system-jobs.ts)). The pass freezes new replay cases, drafts skill and Expression candidates, and replays `pending_replay` candidates. `ethos nightly run [<id>]` runs the same pass once, on demand, whatever this key says.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nightlyPass.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Schedule the pass. Any value other than the literal `true` reads as `false`. |
| `nightlyPass.cron` | cron expression | `0 3 * * *` | When the pass fires. Only meaningful when `enabled` is `true`. |

```yaml
nightlyPass.enabled: true
nightlyPass.cron: 0 3 * * *
```

Notes:

- **Off by default means candidates are not replayed on a schedule.** A draft from the post-turn fork, `skill_propose`, `ethos evolve` or `ethos personality evolve` sits in `pending_replay` until `ethos learning replay <id>` or `ethos nightly run` measures it, or a human approves it with a reason. `autoApprove` and `skill_evolution.promotion: auto` do not skip this wait: nothing promotes itself without a `pass` replay.
- **With it off, no new cases are frozen on a schedule.** The pass freezes up to 10 cases per personality per run. Without regression cases in the pool, a replay scores `incomplete` for too few cases, and the candidate waits for a human.
- The schedule only fires while a serving process runs. `ethos chat` alone runs no cron.
- How many candidates one run replays, and what each may spend, are [`learningReplay.*`](#learning-replay) settings.

## evolver.cron_enabled {#evolver-cron-enabled}

Type: boolean · Default: `false`

When `true`, a serving process (`ethos serve`, `ethos gateway start`, `ethos boot`) creates a `skill-evolver` cron job that runs `ethos evolve run --quiet` on the schedule defined by [`evolver.schedule`](#evolver-schedule) (`systemJobSpecs`, [`packages/wiring/src/system-jobs.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/wiring/src/system-jobs.ts)). `false` removes the job the next time a serving process starts.

```yaml
evolver.cron_enabled: true
```

## evolver.schedule {#evolver-schedule}

Type: string (5-field cron expression) · Default: `"0 3 * * *"`

Controls when the evolve cron fires. Only meaningful when [`evolver.cron_enabled`](#evolver-cron-enabled) is `true`.

```yaml
evolver.schedule: 0 3 * * *
```

Notes:

- The schedule only fires while a serving process runs. `ethos chat` alone runs no cron.
- Each run drafts for the default `personality` in this file, and submits every draft to the learning inbox as a candidate. None goes live without a `pass` replay or a human approval; see [Why does a learned change need a replay before it goes live?](../explanation/learning-inbox.md).
- Per-personality skill evolution keys (`skill_evolution.enabled`, `promotion`, `scope` and the rest) live in the [personality config.yaml](./personality-yaml.md#skill-evolution), not here. The evolver cron does not read `skill_evolution.enabled`: that key gates the post-turn fork and the nightly skill drafter.

## voice.tier {#voice-tier}

Type: `pipeline` | `realtime` · Default: unset (the surface decides)

The deployment's default voice engine. `pipeline` — speech-to-text → the agent turn → text-to-speech, the only tier local providers can serve, and the explicit private/offline mode. `realtime` — one hosted speech-to-speech session owns listening and speaking together. Unset means "try realtime where a provider is configured, otherwise pipeline". An unrecognised value is ignored rather than thrown on, so a typo cannot make the config unloadable. A personality's own [`voice.tier`](./personality-yaml.md#voice) beats this.

```yaml
voice.tier: realtime
```

Only an explicit `pipeline` refuses a realtime call outright — the browser is told `pipeline_preferred` and continues silently, because nothing went wrong. Editable in **Settings → Voice**, along with every key below.

## voice.realtime.providers.\<name\>.\* {#voice-realtime-providers}

Type: dotted roster · Default: unset (no realtime provider)

Named hosted speech-to-speech engines. `<name>` is a label you choose — a personality points at it by name, and [`voice.realtime.default`](#voice-realtime-default) names the one everything else uses. Labels are restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`. There is no `auxiliary.*` fallback for this roster: no entry means no realtime tier.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | string | Registered provider id. Required. `openai-realtime` — OpenAI Realtime, 24 kHz in and out, issues browser credentials. `gemini-live` — Gemini Live, 16 kHz in / 24 kHz out, **cannot serve a browser call** (see the note below). |
| `model` | string | Provider model id. Defaults to `gpt-realtime` for `openai-realtime`. |
| `apiKey` | string | The provider key. Use a [`${secrets:...}`](./secrets-resolver.md) reference rather than a literal. |
| `baseUrl` | string | Override the provider's endpoint. |
| `voice` | string | Default voice id for this entry. The speaking personality's own `voice.tts_voice` beats it — switching tiers must not switch who you are talking to. |
| `costPerMinuteUsd` | float | The provider's published rate, typed by you. A realtime session bills by wall-clock audio time, so this is the only number that turns duration into money, and the only thing [`voice.realtime.sessionBudgetUsd`](#voice-realtime-session-budget) can act on. Absent = no rate known, nothing accrues, and a budget cannot bite. |

```yaml
voice.realtime.providers.live.provider: openai-realtime
voice.realtime.providers.live.model: gpt-realtime
voice.realtime.providers.live.apiKey: ${secrets:voice/realtime/providers/live/apiKey}
voice.realtime.providers.live.costPerMinuteUsd: 0.06
```

Notes:

- **The label buys nothing.** The [local-only egress gate](#voice-trusted-plugins) keys on the entry's `provider` and the constructed provider's own `caps.local`, so an entry named `local-realtime` backed by a hosted model is refused before a session opens. List the **provider id** in `voice.trustedPlugins`, not the label.
- **`gemini-live` is contract-only in this release.** It proves the provider contract is not OpenAI-shaped and is exercised by the shared conformance suite, but it declares `caps.ephemeralToken: false` — there is no browser credential to mint, and no server-relay path ships in this phase. A browser call selecting it is refused with `no_browser_token` and continues on the pipeline tier behind a visible notice. This is a stated limitation, not a bug.

## voice.realtime.default {#voice-realtime-default}

Type: string · Default: unset

Which [roster entry](#voice-realtime-providers) a call uses when the personality names none — `voice.realtime.default: live` for the example above. A **label** from that roster, never a provider id. Naming an entry the deployment does not have is reported as `unknown_entry` and the call continues on the pipeline.

## voice.realtime.sessionBudgetUsd {#voice-realtime-session-budget}

Type: float (USD) · Default: unset (no cap) · Must be `> 0`

Spending cap on **one** realtime session — the entry's `costPerMinuteUsd` times the session's audio minutes, plus what any `agent_consult` turns spent. On reaching it the session speaks a short sign-off and *then* closes, in that order, and the call strip shows a `budget reached` chip. A session on an entry with no `costPerMinuteUsd` accrues nothing, so this cap never fires for it.

```yaml
voice.realtime.sessionBudgetUsd: 1.50
```

Notes:

- A lowered cap takes effect on the next call; **removing** a cap takes effect on restart. Where the live read and the boot snapshot disagree, the boot cap stands — the direction to be wrong in when the subject is money.
- The personality's own [`budgetCapUsd`](./personality-yaml.md#budget-cap-usd) also governs this lane; the lower of the two binds.

## voice.trustedPlugins {#voice-trusted-plugins}

Type: comma-separated provider ids · Default: key absent (gate off)

The local-only egress gate. **Declaring the key at all arms it** — an empty value therefore means "trust nothing non-local" and is not the same as omitting the key. Providers advertising `caps.local` (`local-stt`, `local-tts`, `command-stt`, `command-tts`) always pass; every other provider must be named by its **provider id**. A refused provider fails at resolution, before it is handed a byte, on every surface — gateway, browser, `ethos doctor`, and the realtime mint.

```yaml
voice.trustedPlugins: openai-tts, openai-realtime
```

Notes:

- **Settings → Voice → Restrict voice egress** arms the gate and edits the list. The declared-but-empty form is the one shape it cannot write (the web config writer drops empty values) — set that line by hand.
- The refusal reads `<kind> provider "<id>" is not local and is not in voice.trustedPlugins — refusing to send audio off this machine`. See [Keep voice on this machine](../how-to/local-voice.md#keep-voice-on-this-machine).

## voice.defaultMode {#voice-default-mode}

Type: `off` | `mirror_inbound` | `all` · Default: `mirror_inbound`

Where a conversation starts on spoken replies, on any channel whose adapter declares voice output — Telegram, Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp today.

- `off` — never speak.
- `mirror_inbound` — speak back when spoken to (default).
- `all` — speak every reply.

An unrecognised value is ignored. Change it per conversation in chat with `/voice off|mirror_inbound|all`; that choice is written to `~/.ethos/voice/lane-modes.json` and outlives both `/new` and a gateway restart. A channel switched off with [`voice.channels.<platform>.ttsOut: false`](#voice-channels-tts-out) stays silent even in `all`. See [Send and receive voice notes on a channel](../how-to/voice-notes-on-channels.md).

```yaml
voice.defaultMode: all
```

## voice.channels.\<platform\>.ttsOut {#voice-channels-tts-out}

Type: boolean, keyed by platform id · Default: unset (the platform follows [`voice.defaultMode`](#voice-default-mode))

Which channels may speak their replies. Accepted platform ids are `telegram`, `slack`, `discord`, `whatsapp`, and `email` (`VOICE_CHANNEL_PLATFORMS` in [`packages/config/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/config/src/index.ts)); an unknown id or a non-boolean value is dropped on read, so a typo cannot invent a channel entry no adapter will act on.

An explicit `false` is an operator decision and outranks the conversation's mode — `/voice all` in a silenced Slack channel still produces text only. An explicit `true` changes nothing on its own; the conversation's mode still decides when to speak.

```yaml
voice.channels.slack.ttsOut: false
voice.channels.whatsapp.ttsOut: true
```

Notes:

- `email` is accepted by the parser but has no voice sink — the email adapter declares no voice caps, so the value is inert.
- Editable in **Settings → Voice**, one switch per channel.

## voice.transcode.\<field\> {#voice-transcode}

Type: dotted group · Default: the per-field defaults below

The ffmpeg stage that normalizes inbound audio before speech-to-text and converts synthesized replies into the container each adapter declared. `ffmpeg` is an **optional** runtime dependency of `ethos gateway start`: without it, audio already in an accepted format still passes through untouched, everything else is skipped rather than delivered unplayable, and the gateway prints `⚠ ffmpeg not found` once at startup.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ffmpegPath` | string | `ffmpeg` (resolved on `PATH`) | Path or name of the binary. Set it when ffmpeg is installed somewhere the gateway's `PATH` does not reach. |
| `bitrateKbps` | integer | `32` | Target bitrate for compressed containers (opus, mp3, aac). Must be an integer in `8`–`320`; a value outside that range, or a non-integer, is **dropped, not clamped**, and the default stands. 32 kbps is a speech setting — raise it only if you are shipping music. |
| `timeout` | integer (**seconds**) | `30` | Budget for one ffmpeg invocation. Must be an integer in `1`–`600`; out-of-range values are dropped. Note the unit: the key is seconds, the internal option is milliseconds. |

```yaml
voice.transcode.ffmpegPath: /opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg
voice.transcode.bitrateKbps: 48
voice.transcode.timeout: 45
```

Notes:

- Only the outbound leg reads `bitrateKbps`. Inbound normalization targets the STT provider's preferred container, which is `wav` wherever the provider accepts it.
- Editable under **Settings → Voice → Advanced**.

## voice.artifacts.\<field\> {#voice-artifacts}

Type: dotted group · Default: the per-field defaults below

Retention for synthesized voice notes held on disk under `~/.ethos/voice/artifacts/`. An artifact is written before the send and deleted the moment its delivery obligation is confirmed, so in a healthy deployment this directory is empty; these two keys bound what happens to the recordings whose delivery is never confirmed. Both are enforced by `Gateway.pruneVoiceArtifacts()`, which runs at boot and hourly.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `abandonAfterDays` | integer (days) | `7` | Give up on an undelivered obligation after this long and delete its recording. Must be an integer in `1`–`365`; out-of-range values are dropped, not clamped. |
| `maxTotalMb` | integer (MiB) | `512` | Total on-disk cap for the artifact directory, evicting oldest-first once exceeded. The backstop for runaway accumulation when neither delivery nor abandonment has fired. Must be an integer in `1`–`102400`; out-of-range values are dropped. |

```yaml
voice.artifacts.abandonAfterDays: 3
voice.artifacts.maxTotalMb: 128
```

Notes:

- Redelivery re-sends the stored recording rather than synthesizing a second one — see [Why does a redelivered voice note re-send the recording?](../../building/explanation/why-voice-replies-redeliver.md). Shortening `abandonAfterDays` shortens the window in which that repair is still possible.
- Editable under **Settings → Voice → Advanced**.

## voice.livekit.\<field\> {#voice-livekit}

Type: dotted group · Default: unset — no LiveKit transport

LiveKit project credentials. Required for telephony: [`voice.trunk`](#voice-trunk) names the trunk, and this block carries the credentials Ethos signs its SIP control-plane requests with.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | LiveKit server URL. Write the WebSocket form (`wss://…`); the SIP control plane normalizes it to `https://` itself, so one key serves both legs. |
| `apiKey` | secret ref | LiveKit project API key. |
| `apiSecret` | secret ref | LiveKit project API secret. Signs the JWTs on the SIP control plane and on room access tokens. |

```yaml
voice.livekit.url: wss://<your-project>.livekit.cloud
voice.livekit.apiKey: ${secrets:voice/livekit/apiKey}
voice.livekit.apiSecret: ${secrets:voice/livekit/apiSecret}
```

Notes:

- **All three are required together.** A partial block is a parse error, not a half-configured transport.
- These credentials make the SIP trunk client and the token minter **constructible** — no SDK and no native binary are involved. Room **audio** is a separate leg needing `@livekit/rtc-node` installed on the host; without it a call is answered, gated and logged but carries no voice. See [Give an agent a phone number](../how-to/answer-phone-calls.md#3-install-the-media-binding).
- Editable under **Settings → Voice → LiveKit**.

## voice.bots.\<i\>.\<field\> {#voice-bots}

Type: indexed dotted list · Default: none — no number or room reaches a personality

Which number or LiveKit room each agent answers. This *is* the telephony routing table — there is no separate number-to-personality mapping. It mirrors `telegram.bots[]`, except `match` replaces `token`: a voice bot has no platform token.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `match` | string | Required. E.164 number or LiveKit room name this bot answers. `*` is the only wildcard and matches any run of characters; the pattern is anchored, so it must match the whole value. |
| `bind.type` | `personality` \| `team` | Required. What answers. |
| `bind.name` | string | Required. The personality id or team name. |
| `id` | string | Stable key used in the lane key (`voice:<botKey>:sip:<caller>`) and in the call log. Defaults to a short sha256 of `match` — set it explicitly if you want the key to survive a number change. |

```yaml
voice.bots.0.match: "+15550000000"
voice.bots.0.bind.type: personality
voice.bots.0.bind.name: receptionist
voice.bots.1.match: "+1555*"
voice.bots.1.bind.type: personality
voice.bots.1.bind.name: engineer
```

Notes:

- **First match in config order wins**, so a specific number can precede a broad wildcard — as in the example above.
- An entry missing `match`, `bind.type` or `bind.name` is a parse error naming its index.
- A dialled number matching no entry is not dropped silently: the call is logged `screened` with reason `no_bot_match` and the owner is notified.
- A `team`-bound voice bot has no single personality to pin, so a call to it falls through to the deployment's default.
- Editable under **Settings → Voice → Numbers**.

## voice.trunk.\<field\> {#voice-trunk}

Type: dotted group · Default: no trunk — telephony is off

The SIP trunk that gives an agent a phone number. A rented PSTN number on a trunk provider is pointed at LiveKit SIP, so an inbound or outbound call arrives as one more room participant. Which number reaches which [personality](../../getting-started/glossary.md#personality) (a directory of files that decides the agent's tools, memory, and model) is not configured here — a [`voice.bots[]`](#voice-bots) entry whose `match` is an E.164 pattern *is* that mapping.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provider` | enum | — | Required. Selects which inbound-webhook signature scheme the gateway's call listener verifies with; the providers do not agree on how a request is signed, and that is the one fact the verifier cannot read off the payload. Values below. An unrecognised value is a parse error and the whole trunk block is dropped. |
| `trunkId` | string | — | Required. The LiveKit SIP trunk id the number is attached to, used on both the inbound and the outbound leg. |
| `fromNumber` | string (E.164) | unset | Caller-ID presented on an outbound `call`. Read by the `call` tool; a trunk with no `fromNumber` dials with whatever the provider defaults to. |
| `username` | string | unset | SIP registrar username for outbound trunk auth. |
| `password` | secret ref | unset | SIP auth password. Must be written as `${secrets:voice/trunk/password}` — `writeConfig` moves a plaintext value into the vault under that ref, and loading a config with a plaintext value here fails. Authenticates **us to the trunk**, on the outbound leg. |
| `webhookSecret` | secret ref | unset | Shared secret the inbound-call listener verifies the trunk's request signature against. Same vault handling as `password`, under `${secrets:voice/trunk/webhookSecret}`. Authenticates **the trunk to us**, on the inbound leg — a deployment rotating one is not forced to rotate the other. |
| `webhookPath` | string | unset | HTTP path the listener mounts the trunk webhook at. Must start with `/`; anything else is a parse error. Left unset, the listener applies its own default. |
| `codec` | enum | unset | Preferred call codec. Values below. **Parsed and validated, but read by nothing today** — the media leg does not negotiate from it. Declaring it changes only what `ethos config print` echoes back. |

`provider` values:

- `twilio` — a Twilio Elastic SIP Trunk.
- `telnyx` — a Telnyx SIP connection.
- `livekit` — LiveKit's own SIP service signs the webhook.
- `generic` — any other trunk. No provider-specific signature scheme is applied, so pair it with a network-level control.

`codec` values:

- `opus` — wideband, where the trunk carries it. The better ear.
- `g711` — the narrowband PSTN codec every trunk speaks. The fallback. (Ethos ships a μ-law and A-law codec, but nothing selects between the two from this key yet.)

```yaml
voice.trunk.provider: livekit
voice.trunk.trunkId: ST_1
voice.trunk.fromNumber: +15550000000
voice.trunk.webhookSecret: ${secrets:voice/trunk/webhookSecret}
voice.trunk.webhookPath: /voice/inbound
voice.trunk.codec: opus
```

Notes:

- `provider` and `trunkId` are required together. A block carrying one without the other is a parse error and the trunk is dropped — telephony stays off rather than half-configured.
- Removing the whole block does **not** delete `voice/trunk/password` or `voice/trunk/webhookSecret` from the vault. Drop them with `ethos secrets remove <ref>` if the credentials are retired.

## voice.inbound.\<field\> {#voice-inbound}

Type: dotted group · Default: no policy — the consumer's own defaults apply

A phone number is the one surface strangers reach without being invited. This block is the answering policy: who gets through, what a call may cost, and where the summary lands. Callers outside `allowlist` are answered by `receptionist` in a restricted scope — no owner memory, no privileged tools — and are refused outright when no `receptionist` is set.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `allowlist` | comma-separated list | unset | Caller numbers that reach the owner's own personality. E.164 patterns using the same `*` wildcard grammar as [`voice.bots[].match`](#voice-bots), matched against the whole number. Entries are trimmed and empties dropped. Unset means nobody is allowlisted — every caller goes to `receptionist`, or is refused if there is none. |
| `receptionist` | string | unset | Personality id answering callers that are not on the allowlist. Its own memory (scope `personality:<id>`, fixed by turn setup — there is no scope setting) and its `toolset` *are* the restriction, and a call turn carries no user id, so no caller's or owner's `USER.md` is read; there is no second restriction system. Unset makes a non-allowlisted call a refusal (`screened`, reason `not_allowlisted`) rather than a screened conversation. |
| `concurrencyCap` | integer | `2` | Ceiling on concurrent inbound calls; callers over the cap get busy handling and the owner is notified. Must be a positive integer — `0` and fractions are parse errors, not "no cap". |
| `perCallerPerHour` | integer | unset | Per-caller call ceiling inside a rolling hour, evaluated over a sliding window. Positive integer. |
| `dailyBudgetUsd` | number | unset | Spend ceiling in USD per day across all inbound calls, reset on the UTC day boundary. Must be greater than zero. Counts **LLM token spend only**, at the provider's own estimate — STT, TTS, LiveKit media and PSTN minutes are not in the total, so the cap trips on real spend but trips late relative to a day's true cost. Browser talk-mode and channel voice notes do not route through the call dispatcher and never count against it. |
| `prewarm` | enum | `allowlisted` | Which callers *would* get the realtime provider socket opened during ring. **Decided per call and acted on by nothing today** — the SIP↔realtime bridge is built and unit-tested but has no production caller, so no socket is opened on ring or on answer. Values below. |
| `owner.platform` | string | unset | Platform id the call summary and capacity notices are delivered on, e.g. `telegram`. |
| `owner.chatId` | string | unset | Chat id on that platform. |
| `owner.botKey` | string | unset | Which bot sends the notice, in a multi-bot deployment. |

`prewarm` values:

- `allowlisted` — pre-warm on ring for known callers only, and warm on answer for everyone else. No provider spend on calls that may be screened.
- `none` — always warm on answer. Cheapest; the caller hears a beat of dead air.
- `all` — warm every ring, including the ones that get screened.

```yaml
voice.inbound.allowlist: +1555123*, +447700900000
voice.inbound.receptionist: receptionist
voice.inbound.concurrencyCap: 3
voice.inbound.perCallerPerHour: 5
voice.inbound.dailyBudgetUsd: 12.50
voice.inbound.prewarm: allowlisted
voice.inbound.owner.platform: telegram
voice.inbound.owner.chatId: 4242
```

Notes:

- **Malformed values are parse errors, not ignored.** Unlike the `voice.wake.*` knobs, a bad value here drops the whole `voice.inbound` block and reports the offending key. A silently-dropped budget or concurrency cap costs real money on a surface strangers can dial.
- `owner.platform` and `owner.chatId` are required together. One without the other is a parse error naming the missing key, rather than a half-built destination that quietly drops the notification this block exists to deliver.
- **An explicitly empty allowlist is not expressible.** A flat `key: value` line with no value does not parse, so `voice.inbound.allowlist:` and an absent key are the same file. Set `voice.inbound.receptionist` and leave `allowlist` out — that *is* the screen-everyone policy.
- An unrecognised field name under `voice.inbound.` is a parse error, so a typo cannot look configured while doing nothing.
- Gates run cheapest-refusal-first: daily budget → per-caller rate → concurrency → allowlist. A refusal releases whatever it took, so a wall of refused calls leaves the concurrency counter at zero rather than wedging the line.
- The end-to-end behaviour of every key here is in [Give an agent a phone number](../how-to/answer-phone-calls.md).

## voice.bargeIn.\<surface\>.\<field\> {#voice-barge-in}

Type: dotted group, keyed by surface · Default: the consumer's own thresholds

How eagerly the agent stops talking when it hears you, tuned per audio surface. A phone line is noisier than a room and a satellite sits across that room, so one global threshold is wrong on at least one of the two.

Two surfaces: `call` (telephony) and `satellite` (a [wake satellite](../../getting-started/glossary.md#wake-satellite) — a separate process that owns a microphone). Any other surface name is a parse error.

`call` reaches the SIP lane's VAD and endpoint detector. `satellite` reaches the `ethos listen` microphone's VAD.

Browser talk-mode is not tuned here. The web talk lane endpoints in the browser, from the [`display.voice_*`](#display-voice) keys.

| Field | Type | Range | `call` | `satellite` | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `energyThreshold` | number | `0` exclusive – `1` inclusive | read | read | Input energy above which the far end counts as speaking. Higher tolerates more line noise and makes barge-in harder to trigger. |
| `minSpeechMs` | integer (ms) | ≥ 1 | read | read | How long that energy must persist before the barge-in is believed. The cough filter. |
| `silenceMs` | integer (ms) | ≥ 1 | read | **not read** | How long silence must last to end an utterance. |

```yaml
voice.bargeIn.call.energyThreshold: 0.4
voice.bargeIn.call.minSpeechMs: 220
voice.bargeIn.call.silenceMs: 700
voice.bargeIn.satellite.energyThreshold: 0.2
```

Notes:

- Every field is optional per surface — tune the one knob a room is wrong about, not all three. Only the surfaces you declare are present in the parsed config; the rest keep the consumer's defaults.
- `voice.bargeIn.satellite.silenceMs` is accepted and read by nothing. A satellite ends an utterance on a count of silent audio *frames*, and a frame is only a duration once the capture device reports its frame size — there is no conversion the config layer can do honestly. To make a satellite wait longer before replying, there is no knob today.
- Out-of-range values and unknown field names are parse errors that drop the whole `voice.bargeIn` block. A threshold typed against a misspelled surface is not a slightly different setting — it is no tuning at all, and the operator would only learn that from a line the agent kept talking over.
- `voice.bargeIn.browser.*` parsed in earlier releases and reached nothing. It is now a parse error naming `display.voice_*` as the replacement. Delete the key; the whole `voice.bargeIn` block is dropped while it is present.

## display.voice_\<field\> {#display-voice}

Type: flat keys · Default: per field below

Endpointing and barge-in for talk-mode in the web UI. This is the browser counterpart to [`voice.bargeIn`](#voice-barge-in) — the web talk lane runs its detector in the browser, so these are the keys it reads.

Edit them in Settings → Voice → Advanced voice tuning, or write them directly.

| Key | Type | Default | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `display.voice_endpoint_silence_ms` | integer (ms) | `700` | 300 – 1500 | How long you pause before the agent replies. |
| `display.voice_barge_threshold` | number | `0.06` | 0.02 – 0.2 | Input energy that counts as interrupting the agent while it speaks. Lower is easier to interrupt. |
| `display.voice_barge_sustain_ms` | integer (ms) | `250` | 100 – 800 | How long that energy must persist before the interruption is believed. |
| `display.voice_speech_threshold` | number | `0.02` | 0.005 – 0.1 | Input energy that counts as speech at all. Lower picks up quieter speech. |
| `display.voice_speech_min_ms` | integer (ms) | `150` | 100 – 500 | Ignore bursts shorter than this. |

```yaml
display.voice_endpoint_silence_ms: 900
display.voice_barge_threshold: 0.08
```

Notes:

- A value saved through Settings is clamped to the range. A value that will not parse as a number falls back to the default rather than failing the load — these keys are read on every talk-mode turn, so a typo must not take the lane down.
- The five keys are independent. Set the one that is wrong; the rest keep their defaults.

## voice.wake.\<field\> {#voice-wake}

Type: dotted group · Default: the per-field defaults below

Deployment-wide settings for [wake satellites](../../getting-started/glossary.md#wake-satellite) — separate processes that own a microphone and connect to the web API at `GET /satellite/ws`. The whole group is pushed to every connected satellite in a `routes` frame on connect, and again whenever Settings is saved.

Out-of-range numbers and unrecognised engine ids are **ignored, not clamped** — the default stands and the rest of the file still loads, so one typo cannot make a deployment unconfigurable.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Master switch for the whole fleet. Only an explicit `false` turns wake off; the key's absence means the operator never disabled it, not that they disabled it. ANDed with the per-node `voice.wake.nodes.<id>.enabled` — either one saying no means no. |
| `engine` | enum | `fallback` | Which matcher a satellite runs. Any other value is ignored. Per-value meanings below. |
| `sensitivity` | number | `0.5` | Match threshold, `0`–`1`. Higher tolerates more transcription slip and produces more false accepts; `0` demands an exact match. A value outside the range is dropped. |
| `confirmationFrames` | integer | `2` | Consecutive agreeing frames before an acoustic spot counts — the false-accept damper. Must be an integer in `1`–`10`. Ignored by the `fallback` engine, which decides a transcript once and has nothing to confirm. |
| `edgeStt` | boolean | `false` | Ask satellites to transcribe on-device and send text instead of audio. The node's probed capability is the veto: neither shipped host has an on-device recognizer, so both report `edgeStt: false` and the server ANDs this down to false. |
| `idleTimeout` | integer (**seconds**) | `30` | How long a conversation stays open, in two places. On a satellite it ends the LISTENING state. On the server it bounds the **addressing window**: after a wake phrase picks a personality, further utterances within this long reach that same personality with no phrase. Must be an integer in `5`–`600`. It ends listening and addressing **only** — never the session, so a re-wake an hour later resumes the same conversation with its history. |

`engine` values:

- `fallback` — the built-in transcript matcher (it names itself `transcript` in `ethos listen doctor` rows). Matches wake phrases against recognized text *after* speech-to-text, so it loads no native binding and no model file. The default.
- `sherpa` — sherpa-onnx keyword spotting in the acoustic stream, *before* recognition. Requires the optional peer `sherpa-onnx-node` (a per-architecture native binary, roughly 33 MB, deliberately not a repo dependency) plus `encoder.onnx`, `decoder.onnx`, `joiner.onnx` and `tokens.txt` in `~/.ethos/models/wake/`. The adapter is written against sherpa's documented `KeywordSpotter` surface and has not been run against a real binary in this repository.
- `openwakeword` — accepted by the parser; **no such engine ships**. `ethos listen doctor` reports it unavailable by name rather than falling through to another engine.

```yaml
voice.wake.engine: fallback
voice.wake.sensitivity: 0.6
voice.wake.confirmationFrames: 3
voice.wake.idleTimeout: 45
```

Notes:

- **Which host reads what.** The desktop satellite matches phrases itself, so it applies `sensitivity`, `confirmationFrames`, `idleTimeout` and `enabled` from the pushed frame each time it arms capture. `ethos listen` matches nothing, so it ignores the pushed `sensitivity` and `confirmationFrames` and reads `idleTimeout` for its capture machine from its own `config.yaml`; with the key absent there, the capture machine's own 300-second default applies rather than the 30 seconds the server reports.
- **`sensitivity` and `idleTimeout` are also server-side.** For a satellite that does not match phrases itself — `ethos listen` — the server runs the match, so `sensitivity` governs how much transcription slip a phrase tolerates and `idleTimeout` governs the addressing window. Both are read from this file on the server, not from the satellite's.
- **Read-only in the UI.** Settings → Voice shows these values and does not write them; the route table below is what the web editor edits. Change the scalars in this file.
- The `~/.ethos/models/wake/` directory is probed on every `ethos listen doctor` run. A missing directory is a warning for a `fallback` host and a hard failure for a `sherpa` one.

## voice.wake.routes.\<id\>.\<field\> {#voice-wake-routes}

Type: dotted group, keyed by route id · Default: no routes

The phrase → personality table. The route id is yours to choose and must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`; an id outside that charset is dropped, because a key the serializer could not write back would corrupt the file later.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `phrase` | string | — | The spoken trigger, e.g. `engineer`. Required. Matched with an optional leading greeting on either side — `hey`, `hi`, `hello`, `ok`, `okay`, `yo`, `hey there` — so a phrase written `engineer` also answers to "hey engineer", and one written `hey engineer` also answers to "engineer". Write it without the greeting; the two spellings are one trigger, so two routes differing only by a greeting can never both fire — the first in the table wins. |
| `personality` | string | — | Personality id this phrase wakes. Required. Resolved against the live registry at wake time, so a route naming a deleted or renamed personality is refused rather than silently defaulted. |
| `privileged` | boolean | `false` | Opt-in required before a **privileged** personality is reachable by voice — one whose toolset can reach a tool the approval layer would stop and ask about. See [Why can't a voice in the room reach a privileged personality?](../explanation/wake-privilege.md). |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Switch a route off without deleting it. |

```yaml
voice.wake.routes.kitchen.phrase: engineer
voice.wake.routes.kitchen.personality: engineer
voice.wake.routes.kitchen.privileged: true
```

Notes:

- A route missing `phrase` **or** `personality` is dropped entirely rather than half-built — a half-route would look configured in the Settings table and never fire.
- **The phrase must open the utterance.** Matching is head-anchored and word-aligned, so "so I said hey engineer to nobody" does not fire. The longest matching phrase wins, and the matched words — the greeting included — are stripped before the turn runs, so `engineer, did CI pass` and `hey engineer, did CI pass` both reach the agent as `did CI pass`.
- **Implicit routes.** Every unprivileged personality also answers to its own name, synthesized server-side and never written to this file. Those carry the id `auto:<personalityId>` — outside the charset above, so they can never collide with one of yours. A configured route naming a personality suppresses that personality's implicit route, including a route you set to `enabled: false`.
- Saving the table in **Settings → Voice → Wake routes** pushes it to every connected satellite. Hand-editing this file applies on the next satellite reconnect or server restart; nothing watches the file.
- Implicit routes are shown in the Settings editor and cannot be saved back — they are not entries in this file.

## voice.wake.nodes.\<id\>.\<field\> {#voice-wake-nodes}

Type: dotted group, keyed by node id · Default: no overrides

Per-satellite overrides. The key is the node's own stable id, which it generates once and persists in `~/.ethos/listen-node-id` on that machine — `ethos listen doctor` prints it on the `node id` row.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inputDevice` | string | unset | Host-specific capture device id. **Pushed on the wire and read by no shipped host today** — `ethos listen` enumerates only its stdin pipe, and the desktop host has no capture device at all. |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Switch one microphone off without touching the others. ANDed with the fleet-wide `voice.wake.enabled`. |

```yaml
voice.wake.nodes.pi-kitchen-f089dce2.enabled: false
```

Notes:

- An entry with no recognised field is dropped rather than kept as an empty object.
- A node muted from its Settings row is muted over the wire instead, and the satellite persists that choice across restarts — that path does not write this key.

## background.acp.agents.\<name\>.\* {#background-acp-agents}

Type: dotted roster · Default: unset (no ACP-native coding-agent job runners)

Real [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) (ACP) coding-agent CLIs a background job can run on — Claude Code's official adapter, Gemini CLI, and any other CLI that speaks ACP's `session/*` methods over stdio. `<name>` is the id the job registers under (a `delegate_task` call's `runner` parameter names it directly, e.g. `runner: 'claude'` or `runner: 'gemini'`); each configured entry becomes its own independent job runner, never a single shared `'acp'` runner with a sub-parameter.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `background.acp.agents.<name>.command` | string | The ACP agent binary to exec inside the sandbox container. Required — an entry missing `command` or `image` is dropped entirely rather than half-built. |
| `background.acp.agents.<name>.args` | comma-separated list | Arguments after `command`, e.g. the flag that puts the CLI into ACP mode. Optional. |
| `background.acp.agents.<name>.image` | string | Digest-pinned container image (`@sha256:...`) with `command` reachable inside it. Required. A bare tag does not satisfy the containment posture this needs — same reason `pi_image` must be digest-pinned. |

```yaml
background.acp.agents.claude.command: claude-agent-acp
background.acp.agents.claude.image: localhost:5555/ethos-acp-claude@sha256:...

background.acp.agents.gemini.command: gemini
background.acp.agents.gemini.args: --acp
background.acp.agents.gemini.image: localhost:5555/ethos-acp-gemini@sha256:...
```

Notes:

- `gemini`'s `--acp` is the CLI's own documented flag ("Starts the agent in ACP mode" per `gemini --help`); `--experimental-acp` also exists but is deprecated in favor of it.
- An entry with both `command` and `image` set registers immediately; there is no separate enable switch. Removing an entry (or its `image`) unregisters that runner — a job naming it then gets the same `not_available` answer a machine that never built the image would.
- Each entry needs its own container image with credentials for that agent mounted in — there is no shared auth story across entries. Neither agent's credential mount is wired yet.

## browser.\<field\> {#browser}

Type: dotted group · Default: the per-field defaults below

How this machine launches Playwright browser sessions for the `browser` toolset. Every key here is an **operator** concern — posture for this host — not personality identity. Which personality may hand its browser to a human is its `toolset.yaml`'s business, not this block's.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `navigationTimeoutMs` | integer (ms) | `30000` | Budget for one page load (`goto` / `goBack`). Must be `1000`–`600000`; an out-of-range value is **dropped**, leaving the default. |
| `commandTimeoutMs` | integer (ms) | `10000` | Budget for one element interaction (`click`). Same `1000`–`600000` bound, same drop-on-out-of-range. |
| `idleTimeoutMs` | integer (ms) | `600000` (10 min) | How long an untouched session survives before the idle sweeper closes it. Must be `60000`–`86400000`; out of range is dropped. Under a minute the sweeper would reap a session between two tool calls of one turn; past a day an open session is a leak, not a cache. A session handed to a human is skipped while the takeover is live. |
| `headed` | `true` \| `false` \| `auto` | `auto` | Whether a session launches with a visible window. `auto` — headed where this machine has a display, headless otherwise (default). `true` — always headed. `false` — always headless. Any other value is a **fatal** parse error. |
| `stealth.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Reserved. **Nothing reads this key yet** — see the note below. Strictly `true`/`false`; anything else is fatal. |
| `profiles.enabled` | boolean | `false` (absent = off) | Persistent per-personality browser profiles under `~/.ethos/browser-profiles/<personality-id>/`. Strictly `true`/`false`; anything else is fatal. |
| `proxy.server` | string | unset | Upstream proxy for every browser session. **Endpoint only — scheme, host and port.** A username, password, path, query or fragment in the URL is refused; credentials go in `proxy.username` and `proxy.password`. **Requires an explicit scheme** — `http`, `https`, `socks4` or `socks5`. A bare `myproxy:3128` is refused, because a URL parser reads `myproxy:` as the scheme. A malformed value is fatal. |
| `proxy.username` | string | unset | Proxy username. Fatal without `proxy.server`. |
| `proxy.password` | secret ref | unset | Proxy password. Supports `${secrets:…}` and is externalized on write. Fatal without `proxy.server`. |

```yaml
browser.headed: auto
browser.idleTimeoutMs: 600000
browser.profiles.enabled: true
browser.proxy.server: http://proxy.example.com:3128
browser.proxy.username: ethos
browser.proxy.password: ${secrets:browser/proxy/password}
```

Notes:

- **Two validation strictnesses, deliberately.** The three `*Ms` budgets are bounded numbers and an out-of-range value is dropped, so the operator keeps running the value they already had. `headed`, both `enabled` flags and the whole `proxy` block are **fatal at boot** instead. For these there is no "out of range" — `headed: flase` or `proxy.server: myproxy:3128` is an operator stating an intent, and substituting the framework default for it is exactly how a proxy someone believed was carrying their traffic ends up not carrying it. Boot refuses rather than fail open.
- **`headed` absent now means `auto`, and that is a visible change on upgrade.** Earlier releases always launched headless. On macOS and Windows, and on Linux/BSD with `DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` set, a real Chromium window now appears on the first `browse_url`. Set `browser.headed: false` to keep the old behaviour.
- `headed: true` on a machine with no display does **not** fail. It falls back to headless and the session reports the fallback once: `⚠ browser.headed: true, but this machine has no display (no DISPLAY or WAYLAND_DISPLAY) — running headless.`
- **`profiles.enabled` is safe for one Ethos process at a time.** The mutex that serialises two sessions over the same profile directory is in-memory and process-local, so a second process on the same host running the same personality (`ethos serve` beside `ethos gateway`, the desktop app beside a CLI chat) never sees it. It collides at Chromium's own single-instance lock on the user data directory instead, and its browser **fails to launch** — there is no 15-second wait and no ephemeral fallback across processes. Run one process per personality profile, or set `profiles.enabled: false` on the secondary. See [run one process per profile](../../building/reference/browser-tools.md#profiles-one-process).
- **`stealth.enabled` has no consumer.** No stealth engine and no stealth-tier tool ship in this release; the key parses and is stored, and nothing reads it. Setting it to `true` changes no behaviour.
- `proxy.password` is never returned resolved to the web UI — Settings shows a redacted preview, the same as `voice.trunk.password`. `proxy.server` carries no such redaction, which is why an embedded `user:password@` in it is refused rather than stored: the URL form would put the password in `config.yaml` in plaintext and hand it back on every read.
- **The browser SSRF guard does not survive a proxy.** Read [the browser proxy limit](../../security/controls.md#ssrf-browser-proxy) before setting `proxy.server`.
- Profiles are keyed by personality id and the id must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`; one that does not is silently ignored rather than allowed to name a directory. See [Persistent profiles](../../building/reference/browser-tools.md#profiles) for what a profile holds and what happens when two sessions want the same one.

## web.searxng.url {#web-searxng}

Type: string · Default: unset — the rung is not offered

A self-hosted [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/) metasearch endpoint, offered to `web_search` as a **keyless last rung**. It takes no API key and holds no secret ref, so it is tried only after a personality's configured provider, the global tool settings, and every keyed backend with a key present have all come up empty.

```yaml
web.searxng.url: http://searxng.internal:8080
```

Notes:

- Taken verbatim and unvalidated, like `web.host` and `web.corsOrigins`. A value that is not a parseable URL means the rung is simply not offered; a wrong-but-parseable endpoint fails loudly at the first search, naming the host and the key.
- Useful next to [bot-wall detection](../../building/reference/browser-tools.md#bot-walls): when a page is walled, a search rung you host yourself is one of the few paths that does not depend on the walled vendor.

## activeContext {#active-context}

Type: managed · Required: no

Managed by `ethos set personality <id>` / `ethos set team <name>`. The runtime writes two dotted keys: `activeContext.type` (`personality` | `team`) and `activeContext.name` (id or team name). Hand-editing is not supported — values are interpreted only when both keys are present and `type` is recognised.

## File location and permissions {#file-location}

`~/.ethos/config.yaml` is written by `ethos setup` and `ethos personality set`. The companion `~/.ethos/keys.json` (chmod 600) holds the rotation pool — manage it through `ethos keys`, not by hand.

The directory can be relocated with the `ETHOS_STATE_DIR` env var, read by `ethosDir()` in [`packages/config/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/ethosagent/ethos/blob/main/packages/config/src/index.ts).
