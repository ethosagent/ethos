# Create Your Own Personality

Drop a directory into `~/.ethos/personalities/<id>/` with three files. Ethos picks it up automatically — no restart needed.

## Step 1 — Create the directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ethos/personalities/strategist
```

## Step 2 — Write the identity

`ETHOS.md` is read by the agent as part of its system prompt. Write it in first person. Be specific about communication style, what the agent prioritises, and what it avoids.

```markdown title="~/.ethos/personalities/strategist/ETHOS.md"
I am a strategic advisor focused on long-horizon planning and prioritisation.

I help identify what matters most, what to defer, and what to drop entirely.
I think in terms of leverage: which actions compound over time, which are
one-time costs.

I ask clarifying questions before giving advice. I'm direct about tradeoffs.
I don't pretend decisions are easier than they are.
```

## Step 3 — Configure the personality

`config.yaml` uses simple `key: value` format — no nested YAML.

```yaml title="~/.ethos/personalities/strategist/config.yaml"
name: Strategist
description: Long-horizon planning and prioritisation
model: claude-opus-4-7
memoryScope: global
fs_reach:     # per-personality filesystem read/write access scoping (path prefix allowlists)
fs_reach.read: ${ETHOS_HOME}/personalities/${self}/, ${ETHOS_HOME}/skills/, ${CWD}
fs_reach.write: ${ETHOS_HOME}/personalities/${self}/, ${CWD}
mcp_servers:  # allowed MCP server names (default-deny; omit or leave empty = no MCP access)
plugins:      # allowed plugin ids (default-deny; omit or leave empty = no plugin access)
skills:       # global skill pool filter (capability | explicit | tags | none; default: capability)
budgetCapUsd: 1.00  # per-session spending cap in USD; turns are refused with BUDGET_EXCEEDED once crossed
context_engine: drop_oldest          # E4: compaction strategy when conversation approaches context window
context_engine_options:              # free-form per-engine options (read by the resolved context_engine)
context_engine_options.preserve_first_n_turns: 1
context_layering:                    # E5: workspace-aware context-file discovery for monorepos
context_layering.mode: static        # static | progressive | off
skill_evolution:                     # E3: opt-in auto-trigger for skill-candidate queueing
skill_evolution.enabled: false       # opt-in per personality
safety:              # per-personality safety config (observability sub-block controls what gets persisted)
  observability:
    storeToolArgs: redacted    # none | redacted | full — how tool arguments are stored in observability.db
    storeToolBodies: none      # none | redacted | full — how tool response bodies are stored
    storeLlmPayloads: metadata # none | metadata | full — how LLM request/response payloads are stored
    redactPatterns:            # regex patterns to redact from stored data
      - 'SECRET-[A-Z0-9]+'
```

The `fs_reach` keys scope filesystem access for the read_file / write_file tools to a per-personality allowlist of absolute path prefixes — closing the cross-personality leak gap.

**Fields:**
- `name` — display name (shown in `/personality list`)
- `description` — one-line description
- `model` — LLM model to use for this personality
- `memoryScope` — `global` or `per-personality`
- `fs_reach.read` / `fs_reach.write` — comma-separated absolute path prefixes the `read_file` / `write_file` tools may touch. Substitutions: `${ETHOS_HOME}` → `~/.ethos`, `${self}` → this personality's id, `${CWD}` → working dir. Unset → defaults to own personality dir + `~/.ethos/skills/` (read) and own dir + cwd (write).
- `mcp_servers` — space-separated list of MCP server names this personality may use. Default-deny: omit or leave empty to disable all MCP tools for this personality.
- `plugins` — space-separated list of plugin ids this personality may activate. Default-deny: omit or leave empty to disable all plugins for this personality.
- `skills` — filter rules for skills discovered by the universal scanner. The per-personality `skills/` folder is always loaded unfiltered; this controls what flows in from the global pool. Default mode is `capability` (only skills whose `required_tools` are a subset of this personality's effective tool reach are included). Set `skills.global_ingest.mode` to `explicit`, `tags`, or `none` to change the filter strategy.
- `budgetCapUsd` — per-session spending cap in USD. When the running cost for the current session key crosses this value, the next turn is refused with a `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` error. Session-scoped: resets on `/new`. Absent = no cap.
- `safety` — per-personality safety config. Currently supports an `observability` sub-block that controls what gets persisted to `observability.db` for this personality. Fields: `storeToolArgs` (`none` | `redacted` | `full`), `storeToolBodies` (`none` | `redacted` | `full`), `storeLlmPayloads` (`none` | `metadata` | `full`), `redactPatterns` (list of regex strings to redact from stored data).
- `context_engine` — name of the context-compaction engine used when conversation approaches the model's context window. Built-ins: `drop_oldest` (default), `semantic_summary`, `reference_preserving`. Plugin authors can register custom engines via `EthosPluginApi.registerContextEngine`.
- `context_engine_options` — free-form per-engine options (set via dotted keys like `context_engine_options.preserve_first_n_turns: 2`). Each engine reads only the keys it understands.
- `context_layering` — controls how the file-context injector discovers `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files. Set `context_layering.mode` to `static` (default — root only), `progressive` (also discovers sub-AGENTS.md as the agent navigates), or `off`. `context_layering.max_depth`, `context_layering.discovery_files`, and `context_layering.cap_total_chars` tune progressive mode.
- `skill_evolution` — auto-trigger for queueing skill candidates after substantive turns. Set `skill_evolution.enabled: true` to opt in; `skill_evolution.min_tool_calls` (default 5) is the threshold and `skill_evolution.cooldown_minutes` (default 60) caps re-queuing. Candidates land under `~/.ethos/skills/.pending/<personality>/`; review with `ethos evolve --list-pending` and `--accept` / `--reject`.

## Step 4 — Define the toolset

List the tools this personality is allowed to use.

```yaml title="~/.ethos/personalities/strategist/toolset.yaml"
tools:
  - web_search
  - read_file
  - memory
```

Available tools depend on your Ethos version. Run `/help` in chat to see what's installed.

## Step 5 — Switch to it

```
/personality strategist
```

Ethos watches `config.yaml` modification times. Edit any personality file and the changes are live on the next message — no restart required.

## Tips

**Keep ETHOS.md in first person.** The agent reads it as a description of itself. Third-person descriptions ("This agent is...") work but feel less coherent.

**Keep toolsets minimal.** Only include tools the personality actually needs. A reviewer with no write access is safer than one that can accidentally modify files.

**Choose memoryScope deliberately.**
- `global` — use when this personality should share context with your other global-scope personalities (e.g., project notes, ongoing tasks)
- `per-personality` — use when this personality's context should be completely isolated (e.g., a persona for reviewing sensitive documents)

**Model routing per personality.** You can run different models for different personalities — fast/cheap for coach, powerful for engineer:
```yaml
# engineer/config.yaml
model: claude-opus-4-7

# coach/config.yaml  
model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```
