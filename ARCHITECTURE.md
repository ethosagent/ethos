Ethos — Architectural Constitution
==================================

> This document is the constitution of the Ethos framework. It defines the
> non-negotiable laws of the system's structure: dependency direction,
> extension boundaries, ownership of critical contracts, and the rules a
> validator mechanically enforces.
>
> This document is intentionally short, intentionally restrictive, and
> intentionally slow to change.

**What belongs here.** Laws. Principles. Invariants. Schemas. Governance.
Boundaries that, if violated, compromise the framework's identity.

**What does not belong here.** Implementation inventory, current state,
package examples, file paths that may move, debugging gotchas, migration
notes, operational how-tos. Those live in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) (working
manual), [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) (process), and the operational
state sidecar that complements §IX.

If a fact would become wrong as the codebase evolves, it does not belong
in this document.

This document changes only by the procedure in §VI. No casual edits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I. Immutable Principles

These five principles do not change by amendment. A change to this
section re-issues the constitution under a new major version; the
previous version remains the authority for code that has not migrated.

**P1 — Contracts before implementations.**
Every replaceable behaviour is defined as an interface before any
implementation of it exists. New behaviours are added by writing a
contract, then writing one or more implementations against the contract.
Never the reverse.

**P2 — Dependency direction is one-way.**
A module may depend on modules in layers below it, and on no module in a
layer above it. The direction is enforced mechanically; it is not a
stylistic preference.

**P3 — Composition is explicit.**
Concrete implementations are assembled in named composition roots,
nowhere else. Code never reaches for siblings, globals, or process
environment at use time.

**P4 — Personality is structure, not prose.**
A personality is a schema-bound component whose fields determine tool
access, memory scope, model routing, filesystem reach, and safety
policy. Personality is not a system prompt string and may not grant any
capability the schema does not express.

**P5 — Safety primitives are non-optional.**
Every inbound message, every outbound message, and every tool invocation
crosses a safety boundary. Removing the boundary, downgrading the
boundary, or routing around the boundary is not within the power of any
extension or app.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## II. Runtime Boundary

The primary mental model.

                         │ Contracts  │      interfaces, zero internal deps
                         └────────────┘
```

**Contracts** are the floor: pure TypeScript interfaces, value types,
discriminated unions. They have no internal dependencies. Everything
else depends on them.

**Core** is the framework engine: the agent loop, the registries, the
default context engines, and the safety primitives mandated by §V. Core
depends on contracts only.

**Extensions** are concrete implementations of contracts: providers,
tools, memory backends, platform adapters, persistence stores, content
bundles. Extensions depend on contracts and on core; they do not assume
the presence of sibling extensions outside the patterns in §IV.

**Wiring** is the composition layer: the only layer that imports
extensions by name and assembles them into a running system.

**Apps** are user-facing entry points: CLIs, TUIs, web clients, IDE
extensions, protocol servers. Apps drive wiring; they do not bypass it.

The layering is total: every module the framework owns belongs to
exactly one layer, and its imports are constrained by the layer's
position in this diagram.

A module that opens a network listener or otherwise serves a protocol is
an app, regardless of which workspace directory it currently occupies.

Layer membership is determined by role, not by directory. The
operational state of the codebase may diverge from layer boundaries
during a refactor; the constitution describes the target.

Apps may carry their own thin wiring adapter, provided the shared
topology lives in `packages/wiring/` and the app adapter only adds
app-specific singletons.

An app belongs in this monorepo only if it is a first-party Ethos
surface. Third-party integrations live in their own repositories against
the published contracts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## III. Architectural Laws

Each law is a one-sentence rule with a one-sentence rationale. Laws are
binding and are enforced mechanically by §IX unless explicitly marked
prose-only.

### Law 1 — Contracts are pure
Modules in the contracts layer must not depend on any other internal
workspace package. External runtime dependencies are permitted only when
they author the schema language itself (zod, oRPC, Protobuf-TS).
*Rationale:* a contract that imports a sibling becomes structurally
bound to it; a contract that depends on a typed-DSL library is still a
contract.

### Law 2 — Core does not import concrete implementations
The core layer imports contracts only. It does not import an LLM
provider, a tool, a memory backend, a session store, a platform adapter,
a persistence backend, or any extension that implements an injection
seam. *Rationale:* the engine must be swappable independent of what is
plugged into it.

### Law 3 — Wiring is the only composition root
Only wiring modules import concrete extensions by name and assemble them.
*Rationale:* the system's runtime topology must exist in exactly one
place.

### Law 4 — Extensions implement contracts
An extension is a replaceable module that implements one or more
contracts. Extensions may depend on sibling extensions. The §IV patterns
are guidance for healthy sibling dependencies, not validator-enforced
categories. *Rationale:* requiring contract mediation for every
cross-extension call has higher cost than benefit when the boundary is
not a security boundary.

### Law 5 — Apps do not bypass wiring
An app imports wiring and contracts. An app does not import a concrete
extension directly. *Rationale:* a second composition root re-creates
the topology and breaks the substitution model.

### Law 6 — Personality is schema-bound
A personality's behaviour is fully determined by the fields of the
frozen personality schema. Code does not read personality identity from
prompt text, filename heuristics, or any unschematised source.
*Rationale:* personality is the framework's primary axis of variation;
if the schema does not express a capability, the framework does not
honour it.

### Law 7 — Storage abstraction guards the personality boundary
Modules that read or write user-authored files on a personality's behalf
use the Storage contract. All other filesystem access — internal state,
logs, pidfiles, journals, database-driver files, system paths,
build-time tooling — may use raw `node:fs`. *Rationale:* Storage exists
to make personality `fs_reach` enforceable; outside that boundary it
adds complexity without safety gain.

### Law 8 — Tool execution respects the personality toolset
The tool registry filters tool definitions presented to the model by
personality toolset and rejects calls outside the allowlist at execution
time. Rejected calls produce typed error results that maintain the
model's message contract. *Rationale:* a permissive registry undermines
the personality schema.

### Law 9 — Imports are extensionless internally
Internal relative imports omit the file extension. *Rationale:* the
codebase runs without a build step in development; extensionful imports
break that contract and force a build dependency on every contributor.

### Law 10 — Library code is silent
Library code outside designated app entry points uses the `Logger`
contract for all output. `console.*` is permitted only in app entry
modules and in build/test tooling. *Rationale:* silent libraries
compose; chatty libraries pollute every embedder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IV. Extension Patterns

The patterns below are operational guidance — common shapes that
healthy sibling dependencies take. They are recommendations, not
validator-enforced categories. A new pattern does not require an
amendment; it is simply a new common shape.

**Pattern A — Wrapper.**
A tool-layer extension wraps a single service-layer extension to expose
its capability to the model. The wrapper has no behaviour beyond
translating between the service and the tool contract.

**Pattern B — Safety decoration.**
An extension that crosses a trust boundary depends on the safety
extension that polices that boundary. The dependency is structural: the
boundary cannot be optional or runtime-injectable.

**Pattern C — Content bundle.**
An extension that ships static content (skills, prompts, manifests)
depends on the loader extension that interprets that content. The
root-level `skills/` package (`@ethosagent/skills-library`) is the
bundled skill library, organized into category folders
(`software-development/`, `github/`, `framework/`).
`~/.ethos/skills/` is the user's own skill directory.

**Pattern D — Protocol bridge.**
An extension that adapts an external protocol depends on the contract
module for that protocol, not on any sibling implementation of the same
protocol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## V. Safety Constitution

These rules are absolute. They have no exception path. They predate any
feature and outlive any release. Amendments to this section follow §VI
structural-class rules.

Safety primitives located in the core layer follow the same bump
procedure as the engine itself; breaking changes require the unanimous
maintainer agreement that core changes require.

**S1 — Tool allowlist is authoritative.**
The personality toolset is the sole authority on which tools the model
may invoke. Enforcement happens at both definition time (the model sees
only allowed tools) and execution time (the registry rejects disallowed
calls). No code path circumvents the allowlist.

**S2 — Sandbox attestation is binding.**
A tool that executes untrusted code does so inside an attested sandbox.
The attestation declares confinement properties; the framework treats a
failed or absent attestation as untrusted and applies the strictest
classifier.

**S3 — Outbound deduplication is centralised.**
Outbound messages on every channel pass through a single deduplication
chokepoint keyed on session identity and message content. Channel
adapters do not implement their own deduplication. A duplicate is a
silent drop.

**S4 — Tool progress is internal by default.**
Progress events emitted by tools are framework-internal unless the tool
author explicitly opts an event into user visibility. The framework
never promotes an internal event to user visibility on a tool's behalf.

**S5 — Hooks enforce, they do not merely observe.**
A hook that asserts a precondition must prevent the gated action when
the precondition fails. Three execution models exist (parallel observer,
sequential modifier, sequential claimer). Preventing an action requires
the modifier or claimer model. Emitting an event without preventing the
action is a contract violation.

**S6 — Inbound text passes safety injection.**
Every inbound user message and every retrieved memory passes through the
safety injection pipeline before reaching the LLM. The pipeline is part
of core; it cannot be opted out of by personality, channel, or tool.

**S7 — Boundary errors are user-facing.**
A boundary violation — storage scope, tool allowlist, sandbox
attestation, safety injection failure — surfaces as a typed error to
the operator. Silent failures are forbidden.

**S8 — Plugin contract compatibility is strict.**
A plugin declares the contract major version it was built against. The
loader rejects mismatches without overlap. *Rationale:* overlap
deprecation has, historically, become permanent compatibility.

**S9 — Secret values are stored exclusively in SecretsResolver.**
A secret value — API key, bearer token, OAuth token, password, or any
credential — must never be written to a config file, personality file,
MCP server config, export archive, or any storage path outside the
`SecretsResolver` interface. Config files may reference a secret by
name (for documentation or manifest purposes) but never by value.
`SecretsResolver` is the sole storage and retrieval path for all
credential material. No exception path exists for this rule.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VI. Change Governance

This document changes only by the procedure below.

### Amendment classes

| Class | Examples | Approvals | Validator update | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Editorial | typo, wording, broken link | 1 maintainer | none | No semantic change. |
| Clarifying | rephrasing a law without changing its scope | 1 maintainer | none | Owner of the affected contract must sign off. |
| Substantive | adding a law, narrowing a law, adding or expiring an exception, adding an extension pattern | 2 maintainers | required, same PR | CHANGELOG entry naming the class. |
| Structural | adding/removing a layer, changing the runtime boundary, adding a new contract type, changing a frozen-schema ownership | unanimous maintainer agreement, RFC | required, same PR | Migration note for non-compliant code. |
| Constitutional | any change to §I (Immutable Principles) | re-issue under a new constitution version | required, same PR | The previous version remains authoritative for unmigrated code. |
| Schema | adding/removing/renaming a field on a frozen schema | per §VII bump procedure for that schema | required | Mandatory schema drift gate update. |

### Required artefacts for substantive or larger amendments

1. A PR modifying this document.
2. A matching update to §IX rules with passing tests.
3. A CHANGELOG entry naming the amendment class.
4. A migration document when an existing module becomes non-compliant.

### Forbidden modifications

A modification that makes a law unenforceable — by removing its
validator rule without removing the law, by softening the rule's
phrasing to permit the violation, or by adding an exception broader than
a single named module — is itself a constitutional violation and is
treated as a §IX failure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VII. Frozen Schemas

A frozen schema is a contract whose surface is governed beyond ordinary
type changes. Every frozen schema has:

- A canonical contract module.
- A mechanical drift gate (a counter, a constant, or an enumeration test).
- A named owner.
- A bump procedure.

The personality schema is the worked example. [Personality governance](docs/content/building/explanation/personality-governance.md) explains how its freeze rule and the generated character sheet operationalise this section for `PersonalityConfig` — the personality-alignment phase removed four non-identity fields (`skin`, `busyInputMode`, `verbosity`, `metadata`) under exactly the procedure below.

### Roster

| Schema | Owner | Bump trigger | Drift gate kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personality schema | Any two repository maintainers | Adding, removing, or renaming a top-level field | Field-count file |
| Plugin contract | Plugin platform maintainers | Any breaking change to a field consumed by external plugin authors | Contract-major constant |
| LLM provider contract | LLM platform maintainers | A change to the streaming chunk union or the provider feature surface | Variant enumeration test |
| Hook execution model | Repository maintainers (unanimous) | Adding, removing, or renaming an execution model | Method-count test |
| Storage contract | Any two repository maintainers | A change to the error contract, the atomicity guarantees, or the boundary model | Method-shape test |
| Memory contract | Any two repository maintainers | Adding, removing, or renaming a method on `MemoryProvider` | Method-count test (`memory-method-count`) |
| Agent event union | Any two repository maintainers | Adding, removing, or renaming a variant | Variant enumeration test |
| Tool contract | Any two repository maintainers | A change that affects already-shipped tool packages | Shape test |

### Bump obligations

Every schema bump requires, in the same commit:

1. The owner's approval per the schema's row.
2. The drift gate updated in lockstep.
3. A migration document or CHANGELOG entry stating the obligation on
   downstream code.
4. No-overlap deprecation: removed fields are removed in the same
   release as their replacement, unless the migration document
   explicitly authorises overlap and bounds it to a single release.

### Categories that may never become frozen-schema fields

These categories belong to skills, tools, memory, or per-channel adapter
configuration. They may not become top-level fields on the personality,
plugin, or provider schemas.

- Voice, speech synthesis, audio output configuration.
- Emotion, mood, sentiment tags.
- Per-channel display affordances or response templates.
- Anything that grants the model a capability the toolset does not
  already express.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## VIII. Exception Policy

No law in §III, §V, or §VII is overridden by a permanent exception. An
exception is a temporary, named, time-bounded carve-out.

### Required fields on every exception

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | A stable identifier referenced by validator output. |
| `law` | The article and number of the law being suspended. |
| `scope` | The smallest path, module, or symbol the exception covers. |
| `reason` | A one-sentence explanation, including the cost of not granting it. |
| `owner` | A named maintainer responsible for removal. |
| `created` | The date the exception was opened (ISO-8601). |
| `removal_condition` | The observable condition that closes the exception. |
| `review_by` | The date by which the exception is re-justified or removed. |

### Forbidden exception shapes

- Indefinite exceptions ("until further notice", "TBD").
- Exceptions without a named owner.
- Exceptions whose `removal_condition` is "best effort" or otherwise
  unobservable.
- Exceptions to §V Safety Constitution rules. Safety rules are amended
  through §VI or not at all.
- Exceptions broader than a single named scope. A pattern-wide
  exception is a law change, not an exception.

### Expiry

An exception whose `review_by` date has passed without a renewal PR is
treated as expired. The validator surfaces expired exceptions as
violations. There is no automatic renewal. There is no
permanent-grandfather list anywhere in this constitution.

### Where exceptions live

Active exceptions are tracked in the operational state sidecar referenced
from §IX, not in this document. The constitution defines the policy; the
sidecar holds the entries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## IX. Validator-Enforced Rules

The block below is the mechanically-checkable projection of this
constitution. It encodes the *structure* of enforcement, not the
*inventory* of current modules. Inventory (which package is at which
path, which sibling dependency matches which pattern, which exceptions
are currently active) lives in the operational state sidecar
(`.architecture-state.yaml` at the repo root) and is updated freely.

Where this section and the prose above conflict, the prose is
authoritative and the YAML is a bug to be fixed in the next amendment.

```yaml
# ARCHITECTURE-RULES v1
# Parser contract: a single YAML document inside the first ```yaml fence
# whose first non-blank line is `# ARCHITECTURE-RULES v1`.
# The validator reads this block plus `.architecture-state.yaml` and
# exits non-zero on any unmatched violation.

## Companion documents

This document is the constitution. The following documents complement it
and may be edited freely; they are not constitutional.

- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) / [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) — working manual:
  conventions, gotchas, runtime quirks, and the "how to use this
  codebase" reference.
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — process: PR conventions,
  schema-bump workflows, doc-sync rule.
- [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) — visual and UX design system.
- [.agents/skills/docs/SKILL.md](./.agents/skills/docs/SKILL.md) — documentation information architecture (the `/docs` skill).
- `.architecture-state.yaml` — the operational sidecar referenced from
  §IX: current layer paths, sibling-pattern instances, active exceptions.
  Updated freely as the codebase evolves; never the authority on what is
  allowed, only on what currently exists.

If a question has no answer in this document, the answer is: the
constitution is silent, and the working manual or the codebase decides.
The constitution speaks only on the matters it speaks on.
