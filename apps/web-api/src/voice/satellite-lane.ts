// One connected wake satellite, server-side.
//
// Same posture as `VoiceLane`, deliberately: a lane owns EXACTLY one WebSocket
// and nothing outside it, every field below is an instance field, and the
// transport is injected as `send` so the protocol is testable without a socket.
// Two microphones in two rooms are two `SatelliteLane` objects that cannot
// observe each other. The one shared object is the `SatelliteRegistry`, which
// holds the per-node ROWS the UI renders — never per-utterance audio.
//
// What is different from the browser lane is what a room is: the client is an
// appliance nobody is looking at, so a wake it sends must be RE-RESOLVED here
// (its pushed routing table can be one push stale), the reply is spoken into a
// room rather than into a tab, and the microphone must be told when it may
// listen again.
//
// ── WHO DECIDES THAT A TURN HAPPENS ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A microphone in a room hears everything. What separates an instruction from
// a conversation happening near the appliance is ADDRESSING, and this lane is
// where addressing is decided, because this is where the transcript is:
//
//   phraseMatch: true   The node compared sound against the pushed table before
//                       it sent anything. Its `wake` names a route; we
//                       re-resolve and trust it, and we do NOT match again —
//                       a second gate on a transcript that renders the phrase
//                       differently from the way the spotter heard it would
//                       refuse the utterance the node correctly woke on.
//
//   phraseMatch: false  The node heard SOUND. Every utterance is transcribed
//                       and then matched HERE against the effective route
//                       table. A match picks the personality and is stripped
//                       from the text; an unmatched utterance inside the
//                       addressing window continues the conversation already in
//                       progress; anything else runs no turn, calls no model,
//                       and is discarded with a `transcript` and a `turn_end`.
//
// THE ADDRESSING WINDOW is per-lane and per-connection. It holds who the room
// is talking to and when it last said something, so "tell me more" reaches the
// personality that answered a moment ago. It is NOT the session: the session
// lives in the store under a lane key derived from the stable node id, so a
// reconnect — which an operator experiences as a fresh start — drops the window
// and keeps every word of the history (eng-review D15).

   * with its own voice — and the only other way out of that window is a 120 s
   * playback watchdog. So a terminal path that sends an `error` and stops does
   * not merely fail the turn; it costs the room two minutes of dead microphone
   * for a failure it could have recovered from at once.
   *
   * Which is why the two turn entry points are wrapped HERE rather than each
   * terminal site remembering to send the frame for itself. Remembering is what
   * failed: the happy path and the no-speech path each sent their own
   * `turn_end`, and the failure paths beside them did not. A terminal path
   * added inside `work` later — another provider, another refusal, a throw
   * nobody predicted — is now covered by construction rather than by review.
   *
   * The unexpected-throw error frame is emitted here rather than left to
   * `guard`, because the ordering the node sees must always be
