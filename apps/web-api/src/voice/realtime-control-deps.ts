// Binds one browser talk session to its own lane — the "own lane per talk
// session" half of voice V1b (eng-review D6).
//
// WHY THE LANE KEY IS NOT THE CHAT SESSION KEY. A typed chat session is keyed
// `web:<uuid>`; this session is keyed `voice:<botKey>:browser:<client>`. They
// are deliberately different conversations even when the user is looking at
// one window, because a spoken turn and a typed turn on ONE history is exactly
// the interleaving behind OpenClaw #112253 — a consult mid-flight and a typed
// send racing to append to the same message list, each corrupting the other's
// idea of what the last turn was. Shared context across the two comes from
// memory scopes, which is a merge the agent performs deliberately, not one the
// session store performs by accident.
//
// WHY A PHONE SESSION CANNOT COLLIDE WITH THIS ONE. The `kind` segment. A phone
// leg is `voice:<botKey>:livekit:<callerId>` (`VoiceChannelAdapter.laneKey`,
// same encoder). The trailing ids are not what keeps them apart — on a
// single-operator deployment the operator's own number and their own browser
// session id are equally plausible strings, and one could in principle equal
// the other. The kind segment is a closed union written by the surface that
// owns the transport: a browser cannot emit `livekit`, a SIP bridge cannot emit
// `browser`, and every segment is URL-encoded so no id can smuggle a separator
// and alias itself onto the other's key. That is structural, not statistical.
