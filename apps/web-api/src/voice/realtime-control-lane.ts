   *   1. the halt is reported, with the same `cost-cap` rule a turn halts on;
   *   2. the sign-off is DISPATCHED — before anything closes, so the browser
   *      has the line in hand while its media socket is still up;
   *   3. every tool call this lane accepted and has not answered gets an
   *      answer, because a realtime session waits forever on an unanswered
   *      call and "forever" here would be the last thing the user experiences;
   *   4. only then does the lane close.
   *
   * The browser owns the media socket on this tier, so step 4 closes the
   * CONTROL lane; the sign-off's own audio finishes on the far side, and the
   * client ends the call when the utterance completes.
