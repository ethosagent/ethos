// The screencast half of a browser takeover (plan B3, T8).
//
// `browser_request_takeover` parks the agent on a clarify and locks its
// browser session. On a desktop the human uses the real window. On a headless
// VPS there is no window, so this lane IS the window: CDP `Page.startScreencast`
// frames down, `Input.dispatch*` up, and one `handback` frame that resolves the
// clarify the agent is waiting on.
//
// THE HONEST BOUNDARY, and the reason `sessions` is INJECTED rather than
// imported: this can only drive a browser session that lives in THIS process.
// A turn hosted by `ethos gateway` opened its Chromium over there, and no
// amount of socket plumbing in web-api reaches it. So the registry is a lookup
// the composition root supplies, absent by default, and a lane opened for a
// session this process cannot see is REFUSED with `session_unavailable` and a
// sentence saying so. The failure a blank canvas would produce — a person
// staring at nothing, believing they are driving a browser — is worse than the
// refusal by a wide margin.
//
// Upgrade posture is the voice lane's, reused verbatim: `noServer: true` plus
// `registerUpgradeRoute` (one `upgrade` listener per server, dispatching by
// path), `originAllowed` for the DNS-rebinding gate, and an injected
// `authenticate` for the session cookie. What is NOT reused is the per-request
// lane and the eviction map: `createVoiceSocket` hardcodes `VoiceLane`,
// `RealtimeControlLane` and `encodeVoiceFrame`, so there is nothing to import.
// The eviction SHAPE below is the same, and the same reasoning holds for it —
// see the comment on `holders`.

/**

 *
 *  1. A frame over `MAX_TAKEOVER_FRAME_BYTES` is dropped, and dropped on its
 *     ENCODED length first (`MAX_TAKEOVER_FRAME_BASE64_CHARS`) so an oversized
 *     one is never decoded. Deciding after `Buffer.from` would bound what
 *     reaches the socket while leaving the allocation itself unbounded, which
 *     is the half that actually costs the process its heap. The decoded length
 *     is then checked as well, for the byte the character bound rounds away.
 *     The dimension and quality caps handed to `Page.startScreencast` keep the
 *     normal case far under it; this is the tail — a full-bleed photograph
 *     repainting — and shipping it would cost the socket seconds of
 *     head-of-line latency for one frame nobody needs at full fidelity.
 *  2. A frame that would queue behind an already-backed-up socket is dropped.
 *     `bufferedAmount` is the honest measure of a viewer that cannot keep up;
 *     the alternative is an unbounded queue of stale pixels, which is worse
 *     than a lower frame rate in every way that matters here.
 *
 * The ack is unconditional because CDP emits nothing further until it lands:
 * a dropped frame that is not acked does not slow the stream down, it ENDS it.
 * That includes a frame this file cannot READ. The ack needs only the session
 * id, and a payload can carry a valid one while its metadata is unusable, so a
 * malformed frame is acked on that id and its pixels dropped. When even the
 * session id is unusable there is nothing to ack against, and the only other
 * way out of the wedge is to stop the screencast and start it again — which is
 * what happens, rather than leaving the lane a still picture for the rest of
 * the takeover.
