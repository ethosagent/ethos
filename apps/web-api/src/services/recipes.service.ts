// Recipes — the install pipeline's orchestration half
// (plan/phases/recipes-gallery.md §3, §4).
//
// `@ethosagent/recipes` owns the bundle schema, the `{{input.*}}` templater and
// preflight, all of them PURE over an injected world snapshot. This file is the
// other half: it gathers that snapshot from the registries, renders the
// character sheet, and runs stage 5's apply/compensate against
// `PersonalitiesService`, `CronService` and `McpService`.
//
// The cross-store awkwardness lives HERE, deliberately, in one file at the app
// layer. Say it plainly, because the alternative is a lie: there is no
// cross-store transaction. Personalities are files, cron jobs are the
// scheduler's store, MCP attachments are a personality-local yaml. "One
// transaction" means COMPENSATING ROLLBACK, and compensation can itself fail.
// When it does, the report names each orphaned object with the page that
// deletes it. That is the honest ceiling, and it is why preflight does so much
// work: the cheapest rollback is the one that was never needed.

   * accepts are offered — an option the page could not act on is not an option.

   *      `secret-binding` (`web_search`: Exa / Tavily / Brave).
   *   2. SINGLE-PROVIDER — no provider enum, exactly one `secret-binding`, and
   *      exactly one `providers/<p>/*` prefix in `capabilities.secrets`
   *      (`engine_ask`, `x_search`, the Search Console pair). The provider is
   *      that prefix, parsed by `deriveProviderRoster` — the same parser the
   *      named-secrets vault's roster comes from — and its fallback name is the
   *      field's `defaultSecretName ?? 'apiKey'`, the convention
   *      `ToolSettingsService.probeCredentials` resolves with.
   *
   * `undefined` when the tool is absent or fits neither shape: with no way to
   * write a binding there is nothing the page could do, and preflight is better
   * off saying it could not check. Several prefixes with no enum is ambiguous —
   * nothing says which namespace a bare name resolves in — so it stays unknown.
