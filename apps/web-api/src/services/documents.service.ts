// Documents service — the operator's only channel to the files the agent
// writes on a headless box.
//
// Containment is REUSED, not rewritten. Each browse root is one of the
// personality's declared `fs_reach.workdir` entries (via `deriveDocumentsRoots`
// — the multi-root derivation; see its doc comment for why this is NOT
// `deriveFsReachPaths`, which only ever returns the first entry), and every
// path the caller supplies is judged by the same `ScopedStorage` decorator the
// agent's own file tools are bounded by. There is no second hand-rolled prefix
// check here: `ScopedStorage.check()` calls `resolve()` before the prefix
// test, so `..` segments and absolute paths both land outside the allowlist
// and are rejected.
//
// A TEAM is the other thing a Documents call can address (`scope.team`
// instead of `scope.personalityId`). Its one root is the team's work
// directory, `<teamsDir>/<team>/` — the tree the members write into
// (brand/, opportunities/, state/, memory/, …). No `fs_reach` allowlist is
// consulted for it: the team directory IS the boundary, wrapped in the same
// `ScopedStorage` + symlink walk as a personality root. A team whose directory
// does not exist yet has no roots, exactly as an undeclared personality
// workdir has none.
//
// A personality with NO declared `fs_reach.workdir` has NO roots at all —
// Documents is unconfigured for it. There is deliberately no fallback to
// `process.cwd()`: that would silently root Documents at wherever the server
// process happened to be launched from, an implicit and unreviewed grant of
// filesystem access. Every method that operates against a specific root
// (`list`/`delete`/`resolveDownload`/`createFolder`/`write`, all via the
// private `resolve()`) throws `WORKDIR_NOT_CONFIGURED` in that case. `root()`
// itself is the one exception — see its doc comment.
//
// The one thing `ScopedStorage` CANNOT do is refuse symlinks: `Storage`
// follows them and has no `lstat`, so a symlink inside a root pointing at
// `~/.ssh/id_rsa` passes the prefix test on the LINK path and then reads the
// target. Every path is therefore walked segment-by-segment with a raw
// `lstat` and refused if any component is a symlink — the same rationale and
// the same carve-out as `extensions/gateway/src/media.ts` (W3.2 exfiltration
// guard). Walking every segment (not just the leaf, as media.ts does) matters
// here because the caller supplies multi-segment paths: `link/secret` has a
// non-symlink leaf but escapes through a symlinked parent. The walk fails
// closed: an `lstat` error other than ENOENT refuses (`reachable` below).
