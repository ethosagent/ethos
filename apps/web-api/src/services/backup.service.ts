// The web half of `ethos backup` (plan/phases/agent-state-backup.md §5).
//
// Three things this service does that the CLI does not have to:
//
//  1. `snapshot: 'backup'` is not a preference here, it is the only legal
//     value (D2). This runs inside the process serving chat turns, voice
//     frames and HTTP; `VACUUM INTO` is synchronous in `@ethosagent/sqlite`
//     and would stall the event loop for the length of the copy.
//  2. It takes `backups/.lock` for the duration of a create, exactly as the
//     scheduled job and the CLI do. A web-triggered backup that skipped it
//     would put two writers on the same databases and the same directory —
//     the race the sentinel exists to close. Released in a `finally`. On top
//     of that it holds ONE in-process operation lock across create AND
//     restore (`claim`), because those two rewrite the same files and their
//     own sentinels sit in different directories and never see each other.
//  3. It restores `identity` and NOTHING else (D6). A live server holds every
//     database open, so a `state` restore cannot pass the core's in-use lock
//     gate; offering it would produce a refusal the user cannot act on without
//     stopping the server. The refusal is HERE, in the service — omitting a
//     button from a pane is not a control.
//
// Archive bytes never move through this service. Download is
// `GET /backup/download`, a raw cookie-authed streaming route; this service
// only resolves and vouches for the path it may stream (`resolveDownload`).
