// Config live-reload foundation — plan/phases/gateway-live-reload.md Phase 0.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. `loadAndDiffConfig` re-reads `~/.ethos/config.yaml` through
// the SAME strict loader `boot.ts` boots from, and diffs it field-by-field
// against the last-applied snapshot. It mutates NOTHING — Phase 0 ships the
// differ and the honest log line, and nothing else. The reconcilers that act
// on `diff.bots` / `diff.channelFilter` / `diff.webhooks` are Phases A–C.
//
// WHY IT IS STILL WORTH SHIPPING ALONE (plan §4). Today an operator who edits
// `config.yaml` under a running `ethos boot` gets silence: the edit neither
// applies nor says it did not. Every §0 row 7-10 case — model, provider,
// storage backend, listening port, cron schedule — becomes a named warning
// instead of invisible staleness.
//
// NOT `fs.watch`, NOT `chokidar` (plan §1, §6). Neither exists anywhere in
// this codebase; the personality registry already proves poll-on-a-known-seam
// beats an event listener racing a half-written YAML file. The caller polls.

/**
 * Why this bot may NOT be added to a running gateway, or `null` if it may.
 *
 * Phase A ships without Phase B (live `channel_filter`), and that is exactly
 * what bounds this rule.
 *
 * THE FILTER STATE THAT DECIDES IS THE INSTALLED ONE, NOT THE PARSED FILE.
 * `Gateway.channelFilter` is assigned once at construction and nothing
 * replaces it while the process runs — installing a filter live IS Phase B.
 * So an operator who adds a bot AND its `channel_filter.<platform>` block in
 * the same edit has written a filter that is not in force: accepting the bot
 * because the FILE now names one would put it live under access control that
 * was never installed, which is the whole reason the cold-boot gate is fatal.
 * `hasInstalledFilter` therefore asks the running gateway
 * (`Gateway.hasChannelFilterFor`), and an addition whose filter arrived in the
 * same edit is refused with a reason that says a restart is required.
 *
 * The cold-boot gate's `process.exit(1)` stays exactly as it is: right before
 * anything is live, wrong afterwards, where one misconfigured NEW bot must not
 * kill bots already running correctly. This refusal is that gate's runtime
 * half — per-bot and non-fatal.
 *
 * Webhook mode is NOT a refusal (Phase C). `addBotLive` runs
 * {@link startAndMountPlatformWebhook} for the hot-added adapter, which
 * preserves the start()-then-mount ordering per adapter rather than per boot,
 * so a `use_webhook` bot gets a live route instead of deliveries that 404.

 * Replace a live bot with a rebuilt one without turning a rejected edit into an
 * outage.
 *
 * A `changed` entry cannot be updated in place — an adapter that is already
 * connected has no partial-update path — so it is a retire-and-add. The order
 * is what matters:
 *
 * 1. `prepare` builds and validates the replacement while the old bot is still
 *    serving. Every refusal (no `channel_filter` entry, a slice that builds the
 *    wrong number of bots, a credential the builder rejects) lands here, and
 *    lands as a no-op.
 * 2. Only then is the old instance retired.
 * 3. If the replacement still fails to commit, `rebuildPrevious` builds a FRESH
 *    instance from the APPLIED slice — the configuration this unit was
 *    actually running, per {@link appliedSliceFor}, never "the file as it
 *    parsed last time" — and it goes through the SAME `commit`.
 *
 * WHY THE ROLLBACK REBUILDS RATHER THAN RESTARTS. The obvious rollback is to
 * re-register the adapter object that was just retired and call `start()` on it
 * again — and it is wrong. `retire` ran `stop()`, and `PlatformAdapter` makes no
 * promise that `start()` works afterwards: real transports destroy their client,
 * their socket, their listeners, or their auth state in `stop()`. Some
 * implementations happen to survive it, which is worse than none surviving it,
 * because the rollback then works everywhere it is tested and fails on the one
 * adapter nobody restarted. Requiring restartability instead would be a new
 * cross-package contract. So the rollback goes down the one path that is already
 * exercised on every hot-add: build a new bot and adapter from the previous
 * config slice, and commit it as a transaction.
 *
 * WHY NOT START THE REPLACEMENT FIRST and swap routing afterwards, which would
 * remove the gap entirely: a `changed` entry keeps its botKey by definition,
 * and for Telegram and WhatsApp that means the replacement holds the SAME
 * credential as the live adapter. Telegram answers a second concurrent
 * `getUpdates` on one token with 409 Conflict, and a second Baileys session on
 * one credential logs the first one out — so a parallel start would break the
 * bot that is currently working. Retire-then-start with a rebuild is the
 * strongest ordering the platforms actually permit.
 *
 * The caller must NOT mark the unit applied when this throws: the retry that
 * the applied-state ledger then owes is the real backstop, and it rebuilds the
 * bot from scratch on the next poll even if the rollback also failed.

/**
 * Close one listener and re-listen it on a new address.
 *
 * CLOSE FIRST, ALWAYS. A host-only move (127.0.0.1 → 0.0.0.0 on the same port)
 * would collide with itself otherwise, and the collision would be reported as
 * "port in use" against a port nothing else holds.
 *
 * THE FAILURE MODE THAT MATTERS is a new port that is already taken. `listen`
 * is expected to be the caller's existing fallback ladder, which walks past an
 * occupied port on its own; this handles the case where even that gives up —
 * the range is exhausted, the host does not exist, the port is privileged. The
 * operator must not be left with NO web server because of a typo, so the
 * previous address (just vacated, so normally free) is reclaimed and the
 * failure is named through the injected logger.
 *
 * If the reclaim ALSO fails there is genuinely nothing left to bind: that is
 * logged at error level, saying in as many words that nothing is listening,
 * and the original error is rethrown for the caller's own guard to record.
