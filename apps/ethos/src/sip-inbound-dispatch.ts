//
// What happens between "a verified webhook arrived" and "somebody is talking to
// the agent": bot resolution, the hardening gate, the call-log row, adapter
// construction, and the post-call summary that rides the delivery ledger.
//
// Split out of `commands/gateway.ts` so it is drivable in a test with an
// `InMemoryCallLog` and a fake gateway — the gateway command is a 2700-line
// startup script, and a dispatch decision an operator's phone bill depends on
// should not be reachable only by booting the whole daemon.
//
// It imports NO gateway package. The one gateway capability it needs — a
// notification that rides the delivery ledger — arrives as the injected
// `notifyOwner`, exactly as `webhook-server.ts` takes its capturing adapter by
// injection (daemon-free doctrine).

 *    owner notice. A call nobody hears about is the failure this plan exists to
 *    fix, so "we could not route it" is still news.
 * 2. **The hardening gate** (`decideInboundCall`) — budget, rate limit,
 *    concurrency, allowlist. A refusal releases whatever it took, so a wall of
 *    refused calls leaves `concurrency.active()` at zero. This is the voice
 *    lane's admission filter; the gateway's `checkMessage` is deliberately NOT
 *    applied (INB-002): its only sender input here would be caller ID, which is
 *    not identity (INB-001b), and its pairing reply is a text send a phone call
 *    cannot receive. Each turn's transcript is fenced with `fenceFarEndSpeech`
 *    (see the runner below). LIMITATION: the gateway's tier-1
 *    `shortPatternCheck` observability flag (`channel.injection_detected`) is
 *    not recorded for call transcripts; the fence is.
 * 3. **Personality selection** — `restricted` (always, INB-001b) pins the
 *    receptionist, whose `personality:<id>` memory scope and `toolset` ARE the
 *    restriction.
 * 4. **The call-log row** — `ringing` at dispatch, `live` on answer,
 *    `completed`/`failed` at end, `endedAt` on every terminal transition.
 * 5. **The slot** — released in a `finally` when setup did not reach a live
 *    call, and by `onEnded` when it did.
