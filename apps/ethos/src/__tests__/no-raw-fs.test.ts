// Law 7 enforcement — `forbid_raw_filesystem_on_personality_boundary`.
//
// Per ARCHITECTURE.md §III Law 7: modules that read or write user-authored
// files on a personality's behalf MUST use the `Storage` contract (from
// `@ethosagent/types`). All other filesystem access — internal state,
// logs, pidfiles, database-driver files, system paths, build-time
// tooling, app composition roots — may use raw `node:fs` directly.
//
// Scope of this scan: `packages/` + `extensions/`. That covers everything
// reachable from tool execution and hook execution, which is where the
// personality boundary lives. Tools and hooks ship from extensions/tools-*
// and extensions/hooks-*; the framework engine (packages/core/) routes
// them; safety / wiring / storage primitives sit in packages/.
//
// `apps/` is deliberately NOT scanned: apps are composition roots. They
// boot servers, wire dependencies, and run CLI commands — none of which
// participate in the personality boundary directly. If a future change
// moves tool execution into an app (e.g. an in-process gateway running
// its own toolset bypassing the registry), the scan list here must be
// widened first.
//
// Documented exceptions inside the scanned tree — permanent carve-outs:
//
//   packages/storage-fs/         The Storage implementation itself. Obviously must
//                                 use node:fs — it IS the fs adapter.
//
//   extensions/session-sqlite/   @ethosagent/sqlite opens raw paths. WAL, FTS5, and
//   extensions/memory-vector/    atomic transactions don't fit a generic Storage
//   extensions/job-store/         interface without losing ACID guarantees.
//   extensions/delivery-ledger/   (job-store, delivery-ledger, session-cards, call-log
//   extensions/session-cards/     and notify-queue also mkdirSync the db's parent dir.
//   extensions/call-log/          delivery-ledger's atomic redelivery claim is a
//   extensions/notify-queue/      conditional UPDATE and session-cards derives its
//   extensions/inbound-dedup/     per-session `seq` with MAX()+1 inside the insert
//   extensions/inbound-spool/
//   extensions/outbox/
//   extensions/channel-transcript-sqlite/
//                                 — both need a real transaction, not file IO.
//                                 notify-queue's read-and-consume is the same shape:
//                                 a SELECT then UPDATE inside one transaction, and
//                                 inbound-dedup's check-and-record is one
//                                 `INSERT OR IGNORE` whose affected-row count IS
//                                 the answer. channel-transcript-sqlite mkdirSyncs
//                                 the same way, and its `pruneChannelTranscript`
//                                 additionally existsSyncs the db file so a prune on
//                                 a deployment that never enabled observe mode is a
//                                 no-op rather than a call that CREATES an empty
//                                 database on every machine.
//                                 outbox's bound approve and delivery claim are
//                                 conditional UPDATEs whose affected-row count IS
//                                 the answer — "did this approval still match what
//                                 the approver saw", "did this process win the
//                                 claim" — which a read-then-write through Storage
//                                 cannot express.
//                                 inbound-spool's replay claim is the same shape
//                                 as delivery-ledger's: a conditional UPDATE inside
//                                 a transaction whose affected-row count decides
//                                 which claimant runs the owed turn.)
//
//   packages/a2a/                Same rationale as the SQLite stores above:
//   src/sqlite-task-store.ts     SQLiteA2aTaskStore (T1.6) opens a raw path via
//                                 @ethosagent/sqlite and mkdirSync's the db's
//                                 parent dir, so an async task's terminal state
//                                 and idempotency key survive an `ethos serve`
//                                 restart.
//
//   extensions/cron/src/          jobs.json lock via fs.open(..., 'wx'): exclusive
//   jobs-lock.ts                  create is a POSIX-level primitive with no
//                                 equivalent in the Storage interface; stale
//                                 detection reads the holder body, stats its
//                                 mtime and unlinks a provably dead lock.
//
//   extensions/claw-migrate/     copyFile preserves byte-for-byte content including
//   src/index.ts                 file metadata. Storage models text (utf-8 strings);
//                                 binary copy semantics aren't in scope.
//
//   extensions/skills/           statSync walks $PATH looking for executable
//   src/skill-compat.ts          binaries. Not a ~/.ethos/ operation — explicitly
//                                 out of scope per the storage abstraction plan.
//
//   extensions/skills/           lstat checks for symlinks before reading
//   src/file-context-injector.ts discovery files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, SOUL.md)
//                                 from the user's project directory (ctx.workingDir),
//                                 not ~/.ethos/. Storage scopes to ~/.ethos/ only;
//                                 symlink-refusal on an arbitrary project path
//                                 requires raw lstat (Storage.mtime follows symlinks).
//
//   packages/core/               lstat/readlink walk the segments of a path that has
//   src/scoped/scoped-fs.ts      already passed the lexical fs_reach check, to refuse
//                                 a symlink that resolves outside the reach (G11).
//                                 This IS the personality filesystem boundary, not a
//                                 module sitting behind it: Storage follows symlinks
//                                 and exposes no lstat, so the check cannot be
//                                 expressed through the contract it guards. Same
//                                 rationale as gateway/media.ts and
//                                 web-api/documents.service.ts.
//
//   extensions/gateway/          lstat refuses symlinked path-based outbound media
//   src/media.ts                 (W3.2) before it reaches an adapter — an
//                                 exfiltration guard on an ARBITRARY tool-produced
//                                 path, not ~/.ethos/. Same rationale as the skills
//                                 file-context-injector: Storage scopes to ~/.ethos/
//                                 and follows symlinks, so symlink-refusal on an
//                                 arbitrary path needs raw lstat.
//
//   extensions/gateway/          ffmpeg transcodes FILES, not buffers: the stage
//   src/transcode.ts             writes the source bytes to a scratch path, runs
//                                 the binary, and reads the output back. Those
//                                 paths live in `os.tmpdir()`, never `~/.ethos/`
//                                 — same carve-out as command-tts in
//                                 extensions/voice-providers/, which shells out
//                                 the same way for the same reason.
//
//   extensions/gateway/          The ambient channel digest's cross-process run
//   src/channel-digest-lock.ts   sentinel: an advisory `wx`-flag exclusive-create
//                                 lock with pid-liveness stale detection, so two
//                                 gateways sharing one `~/.ethos` cannot both
//                                 digest the same watched rooms and clobber each
//                                 other's cursor file. The same primitive and the
//                                 same carve-out as `acquireRegistryLock`
//                                 (extensions/agent-mesh/) and `acquireBackupLock`
//                                 (packages/wiring/src/backup-schedule.ts) — an
//                                 atomic create-if-absent has no equivalent in the
//                                 Storage interface, because `exists()` then
//                                 `write()` is the exact race the lock closes.
//                                 Copied rather than imported: packages/wiring sits
//                                 ABOVE extensions/ in the layer model, so its
//                                 version is not reachable from here. Everything
//                                 else the digest touches still goes through Storage.
//
//   extensions/tools-code/       Textual false positive: the `node:fs` import sits
//   src/shim/js-shim.ts          inside a String.raw literal — it is the
//                                 CONTAINER-side shim client source delivered at
//                                 exec time (tools-as-code-api Lane A), not a host
//                                 import. The module itself performs no filesystem

//                                config file), otherwise the first entry of
//                                the `userknownhostsfile` line in `ssh -G`
//                                output for that destination
//                                (`knownHostsFromSshConfig`), which honours
//                                the operator's `~/.ssh/config` including
//                                `Include` and `Match` blocks and so can name
//                                a path neither Ethos nor the operator typed
//                                here. `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
//                                (`DEFAULT_KNOWN_HOSTS`) is only the fail-open
//                                fallback for a `-G` this process cannot read
//                                — no ssh binary, non-zero status, timeout, or
//                                no `userknownhostsfile` line. A MULTI-ENTRY
//                                value is not fail-open: `-G` prints a
//                                space-containing path raw (verified 9.6p1),
//                                so it is read as a list, the first entry is
//                                probed, and the refusal names the whole
//                                resolved value, not a fragment. Whichever
//                                path that
//                                resolution names lives outside `~/.ethos/`
//                                entirely and is read by the ssh binary,
//                                never by Ethos:
//                                nothing is opened, nothing is parsed, no
//                                personality data passes through it. Storage
//                                could not express it even if the path were
//                                in scope, because Storage has no writability
//                                probe at all: `exists()` answers a different
//                                question (the file legitimately does not
//                                exist yet — accept-new creates it), and the
//                                only way to ask Storage whether a write
//                                would succeed is to PERFORM one, which would
//                                mean Ethos writing into the operator's
//                                known_hosts to find out whether ssh could.
//                                Same category as platform-callcapture/
//                                src/detector.ts's binary-presence existsSync
//                                and web-api's documents.service.ts lstat: a
//                                fact about the host filesystem that the
//                                storage contract does not model. It has to
//                                be asked BEFORE the spawn — OpenSSH warns
//                                and CONTINUES when it cannot record a key
//                                (verified 9.6p1: "Failed to add the host to
//                                the list of known hosts", remote command
//                                ran, exit 0), so the alternative is inferring
//                                a silent loss of pinning from a warning line
//                                after the command has already run remotely.
