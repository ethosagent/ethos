// Thin wrapper around the browser's native EventSource for the chat /
// approval / push-notification stream. Two responsibilities:
//
//   1. Parse every `data:` line through the shared Zod schema so handlers
//      see fully-typed `SseEvent`s — drift between server and client
//      surfaces here as a runtime parse error rather than silent type
//      confusion.
//
//   2. Surface the `id:` line (the buffer seq) so callers can resume
//      cleanly. The browser already echoes the last seen id on reconnect
//      via `Last-Event-ID`; the app rarely needs to read it directly, but
//      tests + multi-tab debugging do.
//
// The browser handles reconnect-on-drop natively. We intentionally do NOT
// add a custom keepalive layer (the praxis-stack pivot deleted that work
// for SSE; see plan/phases/26-web-ui.md "Findings deleted by stack pivot").
//
// Connection sharing: a single chat page has several independent consumers
// (useChat, useDrawerStream, usePushEventToasts, StatusBar, Activity) that
// each subscribe to the same session. Opening one EventSource per call
// would exhaust the browser's ~6-per-origin HTTP/1.1 connection pool and
// stall every REST/RPC fetch behind the duplicates. So all subscribers for
// a given session share ONE underlying EventSource, fanned out in-process
// and reference-counted.
//
// Two stream families use that same machinery: `/sse/sessions/:id` (one
// session's events, bare `SseEvent` frames) and `/sse/activity` (every
// session's events on one connection, `ActivityEvent` envelopes). They
// differ only in URL, payload schema and registry key, so the pooling lives in
// `subscribeShared` below and each family is a thin wrapper over it.
