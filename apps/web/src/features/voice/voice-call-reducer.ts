 * the instant the status turns `ended` throws away the only thing on screen
 * that explains what just happened.
 *
 * Two states this actually loses, both reachable today:
 *
 * - The budget wind-down. The sign-off is spoken, `disconnected` lands, and the
 *   `budget reached` chip plus its caption would vanish at the exact moment
 *   they matter. `windDown` is documented to survive `ended` for this reason;
 *   this is what makes that true on screen.
 * - A call that never started. The realtime tier is refused (a dismissible
 *   `notice` above the strip) and then the pipeline fallback ALSO fails to
 *   start — the failure lands in `error` and the call goes straight to `ended`.
 *   Unmounting there leaves the user with no explanation at all, neither the
 *   refusal nor the failure.
 *
 * `error` rather than `notice` is the second condition on purpose: a call that
 * merely ran on the fallback tier and then ended normally leaves `error` null
 * (see the `TIER_DEGRADED_CODE` branch above), so the strip still goes away
 * when the downgrade was the whole story. `degraded` and `micDenied` imply an
 * `error` today, but they are listed because they are what the strip COLLAPSES
 * for, and that must not depend on a coupling somewhere else.
 *
 * Everything here is cleared by `dismiss-notice`, so the post-call strip always

 *   (`voiceCaption`/the call strip) — they do not outlive it in `messages`.

 *   the fix removed; this comment used to describe THAT as the reason not to
 *   project, which stopped being true the moment it was fixed.)
 * - REALTIME: the provider owns the conversation and the browser never runs a
 *   chat turn, so `messages` knows nothing about the call. The transcript is
 *   the page's only record of it — without this, a realtime conversation
 *   appears NOWHERE in Chat and the captions vanish with the strip.
