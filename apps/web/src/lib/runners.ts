//
// A runner is an external coding harness Ethos delegates a job to. Every
// surface that draws one — the run card, the drawer Runs pane, the status bar
// pill, the copy module — reads its label, badge text and accent from THIS map
// and nowhere else. A second harness must be one more entry here, never a diff
// across the render tree.
//
// The accent is deliberately not a personality accent: a runner is a foreign
// process, not an agent that lives here. It is also never assigned to
// `--accent` — the surrounding scope keeps the personality's hue while the
// run's own surface carries the runner's (DESIGN.md rule 2).
