# Mode-aware container healthcheck (W1.2, zero-friction-first-hour plan).
#
# One script baked into the image gives every consumer — compose services AND
# raw `docker run` users — the correct probe for their ETHOS_MODE:
#
#   ui / all → the web-api's :3000/healthz (serves onboarding mode too)
#   gateway  → the gateway's own :3002/healthz (ETHOS_GATEWAY_HEALTH_PORT),
#              which builds a live heartbeat per request — the same
#              buildGatewayHeartbeat machinery behind gateway-health.json,
#              not a second health mechanism.
#
# Liveness semantics (plan W1.2): only DEFINITIVE local failure flips the
# container unhealthy. Third-party unreachability (a Telegram outage, an
# adapter reporting not-ok) surfaces as HTTP 503 "degraded" from a live
# process — that stays HEALTHY, so an upstream blip never fails a fresh
# `compose up` boot. What exits unhealthy:
#   • no HTTP response at all — the process is dead or wedged
#   • in `all` mode, a gateway heartbeat that is stale or missing — the
#     supervised gateway child died while serve stayed up
#
# ETHOS_HEALTHCHECK_WEB_PORT exists for the test matrix only; inside the
# image the web-api always listens on 3000.
