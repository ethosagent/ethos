 * operator would actually write, not every path that happens to resolve to a
 * null device (`/dev/./null`, a symlink to it). `/dev/null` is writable, so the

/**
 * ssh itself failed — it could not connect, authenticate, or hold the session
 * open — as opposed to the remote command running and exiting non-zero.
 *
 * ssh reports BOTH as exit status 255: it exits 255 on its own failures, and it
 * also propagates a remote command that genuinely exited 255. Two things tell
 * those apart, and they are consulted in this order:
 *
 *  1. THE RECEIPT, which is positive evidence. Ethos composes the remote
 *     script, so {@link exit255Epilogue} appends a line that echoes a per-exec
 *     random sentinel to stderr when — and only when — the remote command's own
 *     status was 255. A receipt can only exist if the connection carried the
 *     script to a remote shell, that shell ran the command, and it survived to
 *     report the status: it is evidence that the command RAN, not a guess about
 *     which process printed a line. Receipt seen ⇒ remote exit 255, and no
 *     transport error is raised whatever else stderr holds.
 *     {@link streamChild} strips it back out, so it never reaches a caller.
 *  2. THE DIAGNOSTIC LIST, consulted only when NO receipt arrived — the
 *     `ssh:`-prefixed lines and {@link SSH_SELF_DIAGNOSTICS}, via
 *     {@link isSshDiagnostic}.
 *
 * The receipt is what closes a collision the list alone cannot see. The remote
 * command can ITSELF be an ssh — `terminal: ssh other-host …`, or a `run_code`
 * bash script that shells out — and then it prints byte-identical lines
 * (`user@host: Permission denied (publickey).`, `Connection to <host> closed by
 * remote host.`, `kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer`)
 * and exits 255, while the outer connection was fine and the command genuinely
 * ran. Reported as a transport failure that reads `not_available`, which tells
 * the agent its command never ran — a different wrong answer from the one the
 * list was added to fix, not a smaller one. Both directions were reproduced
 * against a throwaway sshd on OpenSSH_9.6p1: a nested denied `ssh` (receipt
 * present, outer exit 255) and an sshd session killed mid-`sleep` (no receipt,
 * `Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed by remote host.`, outer exit 255).
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITS. The receipt is sound where it exists; these are the places it
 * is absent or unreadable, and each falls back to the list, i.e. to exactly the
 * behaviour that shipped before it:
 *
 *  - NO RECEIPT THOUGH THE COMMAND RAN. The epilogue is unreachable when the
 *    command ends the shell itself: an explicit `exit 255` in the command, or
 *    the wrapping `sh` dying on a signal. A command that does that AND prints a
 *    listed line is still misread as a transport failure. Pinned as a limit,
 *    not a defect: nothing in this file can observe a shell that chose not to
 *    return.
 *  - RECEIPT PUSHED OUT OF THE STRIP WINDOW. {@link streamChild} holds back
 *    exactly one receipt line of stderr, so anything written to stderr AFTER it
 *    — ssh's own line on a connection that died after the remote had already
 *    exited, or a remote background process — leaves the receipt unrecognised
 *    and visible in the tool's stderr. Fails to the list.
 *  - A RECEIPT PROVES THE COMMAND RAN, NOT THAT THE OUTPUT IS WHOLE. A drop
 *    after the epilogue still truncates what was streamed.
 *  - FORGERY IS NOT DEFENDED. The sentinel is 128 random bits per exec, but it
 *    travels in the remote script, so a process on the target can read it out
 *    of its parent's argv and print it. That is not a boundary here: this
 *    backend already sends the remote arbitrary commands and trusts what comes
 *    back (see the containment note on {@link SshExecutionBackend}). The
 *    randomness is against ACCIDENT — a command that happens to echo a fixed
 *    literal — and 128 bits closes that completely.
 *  - THE LIST IS STILL BOUNDED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, and it is still what decides
 *    every no-receipt case. TOO NARROW: {@link SSH_SELF_DIAGNOSTICS} is what
 *    one OpenSSH build was observed to print, so an unlisted fatal line
 *    surfaces as a remote exit 255. There is no seam behind it — the gap opens
 *    MID-EXEC, after `isAvailable()` has already passed, and a probe cannot
 *    cover a connection that dies during a ten-minute test run. What the probe
 *    gate DOES cover is a failure already true before the command is sent (a
 *    wrong key, an unreachable host, a known-hosts destination this machine
 *    cannot write), for every execution tool (`createRunCodeTool` and
 *    `makeCommandTool` in `@ethosagent/tools-code`, `makeTerminalTool` in
 *    `@ethosagent/tools-terminal`). TOO BROAD is the worse error, so the
 *    patterns stay anchored rather than searched for inside a line: remote
 *    output that merely contains `Connection reset by peer` is a failing
 *    command, and claiming it would tell the agent its test suite never ran.

 *    `bash` 5.2.21: with one newline, `echo a \` runs as `echo a __ethos_st=$?`

 *    the caller must see is the command's, not the receipt's — so the epilogue
 *    is status-transparent for every code, 255 included.
 *  - THE RECEIPT ONLY ON 255. It is only needed where ssh's own exit status is
 *    ambiguous, and emitting it on every exec would put a line in the stream of
 *    every command for no gain. So the visible cost is confined to the exits
 *    that are already being adjudicated.
 *  - `echo` RATHER THAN `printf`. Both are POSIX; the sentinel is a single bare
 *    word with no escapes and no leading `-`, which is the one input every
 *    `echo` implementation agrees on.
 *  - `>&2`. stderr, not stdout: if the strip window is ever overrun (see the

/**
 * Why the effective known-hosts destination cannot PERSIST a learned key on

 *
 * {@link sshKnownHostsError} refuses the values that keep nothing by
 * construction. This is the other half of the same promise: `accept-new` means
 * "learn the key on first sight, refuse it if it ever changes", and the second
 * clause is bought entirely by the write succeeding. It often does not — and
 * OpenSSH does not treat that as an error. Verified against OpenSSH 9.6p1
 * against a real sshd, for an unwritable destination and for a missing parent
 * directory alike:
 *
 *     Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (…/known_hosts).
 *     REMOTE_OK
 *     exit=0
 *
 * The remote command RAN, ssh exited 0, and nothing was pinned. Repeat that and
 * every connection is a first connection: silent MITM exposure, while
 * `config.yaml` and the character sheet both say the host key is pinned. So the
 * refusal has to happen BEFORE ssh is spawned, not be inferred afterwards from
 * a warning line buried in the tool's stderr.
 *
 * Only `accept-new` is probed. Under `yes` nothing is ever learned — an unknown
 * host is refused outright — so whether a key COULD be written is irrelevant,
 * and a deliberately read-only known_hosts is a legitimate `yes` deployment
 * this must not break.
 *
 * A file that does not exist yet is fine and must stay fine: `accept-new`
 * creates it on the first connection, which is exactly how an operator adopts a
 * dedicated `knownHostsFile`. What must hold in that case is the DIRECTORY.
 * Same OpenSSH 9.6p1 run: a missing directory is not created and the write
 * fails — with one exception, `~/.ssh` itself, which ssh makes for itself
 * (`hostfile_create_user_ssh_dir`, and the "Could not create directory" string
 * is in the shipped binary) and only there. A missing `~/.ssh` therefore defers
 * to the home directory, so a fresh container is not refused for a directory
 * ssh would have created.
 *
 * WHICH file is itself a question this cannot answer lexically when
 * `knownHostsFile` is unset — the common case. Ethos then passes no
 * `-o UserKnownHostsFile`, so the operator's `~/.ssh/config` decides, and a
 * `Host build-01` block setting `UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null` makes a probe of
 * `~/.ssh/known_hosts` PASS on a file ssh never opens: nothing is pinned, which
 * is the exact state this check exists to refuse. `ssh -G` answers the real
 * question — it resolves the effective config for a destination without
 * connecting — so that is what the unset case consults
 * ({@link runSshDashG}). A configured `knownHostsFile` needs no such lookup:
 * it is passed as a command-line `-o`, which outranks the config file.
 *
 * FAIL OPEN on not knowing; fail closed only on knowing. No ssh binary, a
 * non-zero `-G`, a timeout, or output with no `userknownhostsfile` line — all
 * fall back to {@link DEFAULT_KNOWN_HOSTS}, which is the behaviour that shipped
 * before `-G` was consulted, so an ssh that formats its resolved config
 * differently is no worse off than it was. Refusing every execution on an
 * unrecognised subprocess result would take working deployments down over a
 * check that is advisory. A `-G` that DOES name a destination keeping nothing
 * is positive evidence, and is refused.
 *
 * The ONE place it fails closed without knowing is a multi-entry `-G` value,
 * whose entry boundaries `-G` does not express unambiguously. It is read as a
 * list and the first entry is probed — right for every path without a space,
 * including ssh's own two-entry default — and the refusal then carries
 * {@link knownHostsAmbiguityNote}, which names the whole resolved value, the
 * entry probed, and how to override it. A refusal naming only a fragment of a
 * path the operator never typed was the bug that made this note necessary.
 *
 * Not cached. It runs only under `accept-new` with `knownHostsFile` unset, once
 * per exec and once per probe; the `-G` subprocess is asynchronous
 * ({@link runSshDashG}) so waiting on it costs the process nothing. A cache
 * would have to be invalidated on `~/.ssh/config` edits, which is the same
 * live-filesystem staleness this check already refuses to accept for the
 * writability half.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT duplicated into `packages/config` the way the lexical check
 * is. That one refuses a VALUE, which is as true at boot as it ever will be;
 * this one reads the filesystem, which a `chmod`, a mount, or a container's
 * first run can change under a process that is already up.

 * rather than papered over here.
 *
 * Host keys default to `accept-new` (TOFU:
 * unknown hosts are learned, CHANGED ones still refused); `strictHostKeys` is
 * forwarded verbatim when the operator set it. The "changed ones refused" half
 * only holds if the learned key is KEPT, so `knownHostsFile` is refused before
 * this point when it names a destination that keeps nothing — see
 * {@link sshKnownHostsError} — and when the effective destination is one this
 * machine cannot write (see {@link sshKnownHostsUnwritableError}). There is no

 * the way `--` neutralises a hostile destination: `UserKnownHostsFile=none`
 * means exactly what it says.

 * The `--` goes BEFORE the destination, which is where ssh honours it. A
 * TRAILING `--` would be wrong for the reason an earlier lane removed one: ssh
 * ends option parsing at the destination, so anything after it is sent to the
 * remote verbatim and a trailing `--` runs as the remote command's argv[0].
 *
 * Verified against OpenSSH 9.6p1:
 *   - `ssh -G -- '-oProxyCommand=touch /tmp/x' true` → `hostname contains
 *     invalid characters`; the option is NOT applied and nothing runs locally.
 *     Without the `--` the same argument resolves to `proxycommand touch
 *     /tmp/x`, i.e. local execution.
 *   - `ssh -G -- deploy@build-01 <words>` and the same line without `--`
 *     produce byte-identical resolved config, so the terminator costs an

 * case the remote login directory stands.
 *
 * `sentinel` is the exit-255 receipt for this one exec; {@link exit255Epilogue}
 * appends the lines that emit it, and {@link SshTransportError} says what it
 * buys. It is a parameter rather than something generated here because
 * {@link SshExecutionBackend.exec} has to hand the SAME value to
 * {@link streamChild}, which strips it back out and reads it.
 *
 * ONE SHAPE FOR EVERY CALL, which is a change: `opts.shell` no longer branches
 * here, and the two things it used to select are gone.
 *
 *  - `exec` is gone. It used to front the `shell: false` runner so that "its
 *    pid, its signal disposition and its exit status are the remote command's
 *    own", and it is incompatible with an epilogue by definition — an `exec`d
 *    process never returns to the shell that would emit the receipt. Dropping
 *    it costs less than it reads: the exit status is preserved explicitly by
 *    `exit $__ethos_st` (proved with a real shell in
 *    `__tests__/remote-words-stdin.test.ts`), and a signal-killed runner now
 *    reports 128+N instead of the 255 `exec` produced — which is strictly more
 *    information, since 255 is the value this whole file exists to disambiguate.
 *    What is genuinely lost is one remote `sh` process per exec and the runner
 *    being the session's own pid; sshd hangs the connection up by signalling
 *    the process GROUP, so both still die on a drop.
 *  - The unwrapped `[cmd]` form is gone. With no workdir, `shell: false` used
 *    to send the command as bare remote words for the LOGIN shell to parse. The
 *    workdir variant already went through `sh -c`, so this only ever changed
 *    which shell parsed a `run_code` runner line on hosts whose login shell is
 *    not POSIX (fish, csh) — and it now requires `sh`, which this backend
 *    already required of every `terminal` call and which its POSIX-remote
 *    target assumption gives it.
 *
 * `shell: false` keeps its one substantive promise: no QUOTING layer is put
 * around `cmd`. The caller composed it as a ready remote command line for a
 * stdin-driven runner (`python3 -`, `node --input-type=module`, `bash -s`), and
 * it is still interpolated raw into the script and parsed once.
 *
 * `sh -c` does not consume its child's stdin — the runner inherits the
 * descriptor and still reads the program from it — which is why the cwd applies
 * to `run_code` at all, and why it survives the loss of `exec`: the wrapping
 * `sh` reads its script from argv and never touches the pipe. Verified:
 * `printf 'import os; print(os.getcwd())' | sh -c "cd '/tmp/x' && python3 -"`
 * prints `/tmp/x`, and the same shape carries stdin to `node --input-type=module`
 * and `bash -s`.

 * Timeout (plan D6): the timer kills the LOCAL ssh client only. There is no
 * remote `timeout(1)` wrapper — it is GNU coreutils, not POSIX, and this
 * backend targets POSIX remotes. Killing the client drops the connection and
 * sshd normally hangs up the remote session, but a remote process that ignores
 * SIGHUP, or has detached from it, MAY SURVIVE the timeout. Same for abort.
 *
 * `sentinel` is this exec's exit-255 receipt (see {@link SshTransportError}).
 * It arrives on stderr as its own line, and stderr is therefore streamed with a
 * HOLDBACK of exactly one receipt line: the tail is withheld until more bytes
 * arrive or the process closes, so the receipt can be recognised and removed
 * before anything is yielded. Nothing else is delayed: the holdback is 55 bytes
 * (the sentinel's shape is pinned by ssh.test.ts, "sends a fresh 128-bit
 * sentinel with every exec"), and every consumer of this stream drains it whole
 * — `drainExec` in `@ethosagent/tools-code` and `@ethosagent/tools-terminal` —
 * before rendering anything.
 *
 * The holdback is deliberately NOT the {@link createDiagnosticBuffer} head:
 * that keeps the FIRST 4096 bytes and drops the rest, so a command with more
 * stderr than that would lose the receipt entirely. Two buffers, two jobs.
