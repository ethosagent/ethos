 * `false` — which is every `run_code` call — on the theory that an `sh -c` wrap
 * would eat the stdin a stdin-driven runner reads its program from. That theory
 * is wrong: `sh -c` does not consume its child's stdin, so the runner still
 * inherits the descriptor.
 *
 * These tests prove it end to end with a REAL shell. `node:child_process` is
 * deliberately NOT mocked here (unlike `ssh.test.ts`) — a mock could not falsify
 * the claim. Nothing connects to anything: the local `sh` stands in for the
 * remote LOGIN shell, receiving the remote words joined by spaces exactly as ssh
 * hands them over.
