const GUIDANCE = `## Memory guidance

You have access to persistent memory across sessions via the \`memory_read\`, \`memory_write\`, and \`session_search\` tools.

**MEMORY.md** — rolling project context. Update it when:
- A significant decision is made
- A task is completed or abandoned
- Important facts about the current project emerge

**USER.md** — persistent user profile. Update it when:
- You learn about the user's role, expertise, or preferences
- Communication style preferences become clear
- Recurring patterns in how they work emerge

Keep entries concise. Use \`memory_write\` with \`action: "add"\` to append new facts. Use \`action: "remove"\` with \`substring_match\` to delete outdated entries before replacing them. Read memory at the start of new tasks to recall prior context.`.trim();
