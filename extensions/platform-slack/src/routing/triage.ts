 * May the bot put VISIBLE content into this channel?

 * a room (the `member_joined_channel` greeting, `/ethos ask`, and a
 * `link_shared` unfurl), and each one used to decide for itself. This is the
 * single question they now ask, answered by the same `evaluateChannelMode` the
 * message path uses, so a Slack-local copy of the matrix cannot drift from it.
 *
 * `isGroupMention: true` is deliberate: on all three paths a human has already
 * addressed the bot directly — invited it, invoked a slash command, pasted one
 * of its links — so the only open question is whether the ROOM permits a reply
 * at all. `observe` answers no. So does a mode string this build cannot read,
 * by the same fail-closed reasoning `evaluateChannelMode` documents: an
 * unreadable mode is as likely to be a newer silent one as a typo, and a room
 * that may have asked for silence does not get a post out of our uncertainty.
 * The operator still learns the unreadable string verbatim from the surfaces
 * the room cannot see — `/ethos channel-mode show`, `/ethos help`, the refusal
 * `/ethos ask` returns, and the App Home tab.
 *
 * `isDm` is a REQUIRED parameter, not an internal `false`, and that is the fix
 * for a real refusal: it used to hard-code `false`, so `/ethos ask` in a DM was
 * refused by the channel's mode with a message telling the user to ask in a DM.
 * `evaluateChannelMode`'s first test is `isDm`, load-bearingly ("a DM is not a
 * room"), and a hard-coded `false` here silently discarded it. A default value
 * would let the same omission recur unnoticed, so every caller states it.
