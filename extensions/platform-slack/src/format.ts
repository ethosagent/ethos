You are replying inside a Slack workspace. Follow these rules:

- Use Slack mrkdwn syntax: *bold*, _italic_, \`code\`, \`\`\`code blocks\`\`\`, ~strikethrough~.
- Do NOT use standard markdown: no **double asterisks**, no # headers, no --- rules.
- Structure answers with short sections. Use *Section title* (bold) followed by bullet
  lines starting with • or -.
- Bullet lists: use – or • as the bullet character, one item per line.
- For code, always wrap in triple backticks with the language name: \`\`\`python ... \`\`\`.
- Link syntax: <https://example.com|link text>.
- Keep replies scannable. Prefer structure over prose for anything technical.
- Emoji is acceptable for status indicators (:white_check_mark:, :warning:) but use sparingly.
- Maximum reply length: 3000 characters. If more is needed, summarise with an offer to
  continue.`;

/**
 * Render model output as Slack mrkdwn.
 *
 * CHS-004 — escaping runs FIRST, on the raw text, and syntax is generated
 * after. The previous order (convert, then patch up stray delimiters with a
 * lookbehind) never escaped `<` at all, so a model that emitted `<!channel>`
 * broadcast-pinged the whole workspace, and `<@U123>` pinged a member. Slack
 * treats those as control sequences wherever they appear in message text; the
 * only reliable defence is to escape the angle brackets the model wrote and
 * emit only the delimiters we generate ourselves.
 *
 * Escaping first also fixes the legitimate-link breakage the old lookbehind
 * caused, because the link rule now runs against text with no ambient `<`/`>`
 * to trip over.
 *
 * UBP-051 — fenced blocks and inline code are pulled out into placeholders
 * after escaping and before the header/bold/link rewrites, then restored, so
 * `a**2` or a `# comment` line inside code reaches Slack as written (still
 * entity-escaped: Slack parses control sequences in code too). Pinned by
 * `__tests__/format-code.test.ts`.
