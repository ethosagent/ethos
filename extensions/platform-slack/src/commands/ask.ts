  // `/ethos ask` is an explicit operator command, and "the operator asked for
  // it" is a real argument — but it is an argument about the OPERATOR, and the
  // answer does not land on the operator. It flows back through the gateway's
  // ordinary outbound path as a `chat.postMessage`, in front of everyone else
  // in the channel, and the in-channel acknowledgement below is a second public
  // post. An observed room was promised silence on behalf of the people in it;
  // one member's slash command is not their consent. So the command is refused
  // here rather than overridden, and the refusal is `ephemeral` — visible to
  // the invoker, invisible to the room, which is the one shape that both tells
  // the operator what happened and keeps the promise.
  //
  // There is no ephemeral variant to fall back to: the agent's answer is
  // produced asynchronously by the gateway and has no `response_url` to return
  // through. DM the bot, or change the mode.
  //
  // None of that reasoning applies in a DM, and the gate used to apply it there
  // anyway: `canSpeakInChannel` hard-coded `isDm: false`, so with
  // `defaultChannelMode: observe` a DM — which has no override, and therefore
  // resolves to the app default — answered ordinary messages but refused
  // `/ethos ask`, with a refusal telling the user to ask in a DM. There is no
  // room of third parties in a one-to-one conversation for a mode to protect,
  // which is why `evaluateChannelMode` ranks `isDm` above the mode.
