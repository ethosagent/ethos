/**
 * The Ethos tool-call gate — a Pi extension, loaded with `--extension` and
 * executed by Pi INSIDE the container. It is not part of the Ethos runtime and
 * must never import from it.
 *
 * Why it exists: Pi has no permission system for its own built-in tools
 * (`bash`/`edit`/`write`/`read` execute unconditionally). The extension API's
 * `tool_call` handler is the ONLY point where a host can see a tool call before
 * it runs and refuse it — and `ctx.ui.select()` in `--mode rpc` turns that into
 * an `extension_ui_request` frame on stdout that blocks the tool until the host
 * answers on stdin. That round-trip is the seam Phase 4 routes real elicitation
 * through; this file is what makes it exist.
 *
 * The types are declared structurally rather than imported from
 * `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` so this file stays dependency-free in both
 * directions: Ethos does not take a build dependency on Pi's SDK, and the file
 * still typechecks in this repo.
