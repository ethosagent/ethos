 *  - `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_INVALID` — the effective known-hosts destination cannot
 *    keep a learned key, so the backend refuses before it spawns anything. It
 *    reaches exec DESPITE the `isAvailable()` gate because a probe success is
 *    trusted for 60 s while the thing that check reads is the live filesystem:
 *    a `chmod`, a remount, or an `~/.ssh/config` edit inside that window turns
 *    a passing target into a refusing one, and the refusal then lands in the
 *    catch below. The message was always honest; the CODE said
 *    `execution_failed`, which is a claim that a command ran and lost.
 *
 * `SSH_HOST_MISSING` and `SSH_DESTINATION_INVALID` are deliberately absent:
 * `probe()` refuses both, and neither can become true under a running process
 * — they read config that was frozen at construction — so they cannot appear
 * after a probe success. `SSH_ENV_UNSUPPORTED` is absent for a different
 * reason: it is a wiring mistake in Ethos, not a property of the backend's
 * availability, and calling it `not_available` would send an operator to look
 * at their host.
 *
 * Read structurally, like {@link lastProbeError}: these classes live in
 * `@ethosagent/execution-ssh` and this package must not import a concrete
 * backend to reach them. The strings are those classes' own `readonly code`,
 * which no compiler holds to these, so both sides are pinned by test:
 * `extensions/execution-ssh/src/__tests__/ssh.test.ts` ("SshTransportError
 * carries the code tools-code matches on") asserts the producer's spelling, and
 * `extensions/tools-code/src/__tests__/run-code.test.ts` ("… reports a
 * transport failure mid-exec as not_available") drives that same shape through
 * this consumer.
 *
 * It matters because the alternative is silent: a backend refusal rendered as
 * `execution_failed` sits beside `Tests failed` in the agent's context and
 * reads as a command that ran and lost, so the agent goes and edits tests that
 * were never executed.
