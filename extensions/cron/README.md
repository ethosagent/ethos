# @ethosagent/cron

File-locked cron scheduler that ticks every 60 seconds, persists jobs to `<cronDir>/jobs.json`, and writes each run's output to a per-job markdown file.

## Why this exists

Ethos personalities can schedule recurring work (morning briefings, periodic syncs, end-of-day digests). A heavyweight scheduler service is overkill — this is a single-process, file-backed scheduler that survives restarts, handles missed runs, and is safe to mutate concurrently from the CLI and the running agent.

## What it provides

- `CronScheduler` — the service. `start()` / `stop()` lifecycle, `createJob` / `listJobs` / `getJob` / `deleteJob` / `pauseJob` / `resumeJob` / `runJobNow` mutation methods. Constructor takes a `runJob` callback that the host (CLI wiring) supplies to actually execute the prompt against an `AgentLoop`.
- `CronJob`, `CronRunResult`, `CronSchedulerConfig`, `MissedRunPolicy`, `JobStatus` — types consumed by `@ethosagent/tools-cron` and the CLI.
- `isValidCronExpression(expr)` — predicate over `croner`'s `Cron` constructor.
- `nextRun(schedule)` / `nextRunAfter(schedule, after)` — date helpers used both internally and by the CLI to display next-run hints.

## How it works

`start()` (`src/index.ts:98`) fires `tick()` immediately (so missed-run jobs catch up on launch) and then schedules `setInterval(tick, tickIntervalMs)`. `tick()` (`src/index.ts:179`) reads the current `jobs.json`, walks every active job, compares `nextRunAt` to now, and either skips (advancing `nextRunAt` via `nextRunAfter`) or executes via `executeJob`, depending on `missedRunPolicy`.

`executeJob` (`src/index.ts:220`) calls the host-supplied `runJob` callback, then writes the output to `<cronDir>/output/<job-id>/<timestamp>.md`. Timestamps in filenames have `:` and `.` replaced with `-` so they're safe on every filesystem.

All mutations to `jobs.json` go through `withJobsLock` → `withLock` (`src/index.ts:49`), which uses `open(lockPath, 'wx')` — exclusive create — as an atomic primitive. If another process holds the lock, the caller spins for up to 5 seconds at 100ms intervals, then throws. The lock file is unlinked in `finally` even when the operation throws (`src/index.ts:68`).

Job ids are derived from `name` via `slugify` (`src/index.ts:305`) — lowercase, non-alphanumeric runs collapsed to `-`, trimmed, capped at 64 chars. `createJob` rejects duplicates so name collisions surface immediately.

## Gotchas

- The `runJob` callback is **required** in `CronSchedulerConfig` (`src/index.ts:38`); without it the scheduler is unusable. The CLI wires this to invoke `AgentLoop.run`.
- `tick()` swallows missing-`jobs.json` errors silently (`src/index.ts:184-187`) and per-job failures are logged with `console.error` and then ignored. This package is one of the three allowed lingering `console.warn` / `console.error` per the root CLAUDE.md.
- The `withLock` retry loop is **5 seconds at 100ms** — a stuck lock (e.g. from a crashed process that left the file behind) will block writes until you remove `<cronDir>/jobs.json.lock` manually.
- `nextRunAt` is recomputed only after a tick fires or via `pauseJob`/`resumeJob`. If the system clock jumps backwards, jobs may re-fire; if it jumps forward, the missed-run policy applies.
- `executeJob` writes the output file even when `runJob` returns an empty string — there is no "empty output, skip writing" branch.
- Cron expressions are interpreted in the host process's local timezone via `croner`. There is no per-job timezone field.
- The single-process lock model means running two `ethos` processes on the same cron directory is supported for **mutations** (the lock makes them safe) but both will tick — every job will run twice. Run only one cron-enabled process per cron dir.
