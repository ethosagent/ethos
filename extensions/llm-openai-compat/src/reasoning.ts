// Lane 4b(b) — reasoning/thinking passthrough for the OpenAI-compat transport.
//
// Reasoning models surface their chain-of-thought in two wire shapes:
//   1. `delta.reasoning_content` (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3 via vLLM/Ollama) or
//      `delta.reasoning` (OpenRouter) — handled inside streamChatCompletions.
//   2. `<think>…</think>` blocks embedded in `delta.content` — handled here by
//      `parseThinkBlocks`, which emits the inner content as `thinking_delta`
//      and strips it from the text stream. ONLY well-formed balanced blocks
//      are converted; an unbalanced `<think>` (or a conversational mention)
//      is left in the text untouched (plan Lane 4 risk: "reasoning stripping
//      can eat real content").
//
// `withReasoningOnlyRetry` adds the reasoning-only-turn safety net: a stream
// that ends with thinking but zero text and zero tool calls gets ONE retry,
// NOT gated on any vendor name — the exact mistake OpenClaw #101077 documents
// (its retry was GPT-5-only, so every other reasoning model got zero retries).
//
// Both reuse the EXISTING `thinking_delta` CompletionChunk variant
// (packages/types/src/llm.ts) — no new chunk or AgentEvent variant.

/**
 * Reasoning-only-turn retry: when an attempt ends with thinking output but no

 * provider name — never vendor-gated. The second attempt streams through
 * unconditionally, so at most one extra request is made per turn.
 *
 * LIMITATION — the first attempt's `thinking_delta` chunks have already been
 * yielded when the retry is decided, and nothing retracts them. A surface that
 * renders thinking live (`apps/ethos/src/commands/chat.ts`, and the web chat via
 * the `thinking_delta` SSE event) therefore shows TWO reasoning passes for a
 * retried turn, the second one's reasoning appended after the first's. Only the
 * `done` of the first attempt is suppressed.
 *
 * Not gated on "nothing thought yet", which would be the obvious fix and would
 * disable the feature outright: the retry condition IS thinking with no
 * substance, so a guard on `!sawThinking` can never fire. Suppressing the first
 * pass instead would mean buffering every thinking chunk until the turn's shape
 * is known, which costs the live reasoning stream this tier exists to show.
 * Nothing downstream is corrupted — thinking is never persisted (the assistant
 * row stores text only; see `packages/core/src/agent-loop/stages/stream-step.ts`)
 * — so the cost is a doubled reasoning block on screen, once per retried turn.
 * Pinned by `__tests__/reasoning-passthrough.test.ts` ('retries at most once').
