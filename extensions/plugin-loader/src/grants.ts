// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Plugin capability grants — a consent record, NOT a containment boundary
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A grant records that an operator was shown what a plugin declares it will do
// and agreed to install it anyway. That is all it is.
//
// It does not confine the plugin. `PluginLoader` `import()`s a plugin's entry
// module directly into this process: the plugin shares the process, the
// environment, the filesystem, and the API keys. Nothing here — and nothing
// anywhere else in the loader — restricts a plugin to the capabilities it
// declared. `capabilities` below is what the plugin SAID, shown to the operator
// so their consent means something; it is not a permission set that is enforced
// at runtime.
//
// The one thing a grant changes at load time is revocation: `PluginLoader`
// refuses to import a plugin whose grant is revoked. That stops the NEXT load.
// It cannot claw back anything an already-loaded plugin did — that code has
// already run as the user.
//
// Storage: one JSON map keyed by plugin id at `<pluginsDir>/grants.json`,
// following `lockfile.ts` (the closest precedent — a Storage-backed JSON record
// keyed by plugin id, with read/write helpers and no ambient fs access).
