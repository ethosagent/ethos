// VoiceTransport — the transport-agnostic seam for one live audio session.
//
// The VoiceSession core is transport-agnostic (plan/phases/gap-voice-realtime.md
// §3(b)): it does not know whether audio arrives from a LiveKit WebRTC room, a
// Twilio Media Streams WebSocket (μ-law), or a browser mic. This interface is
// the only surface the channel adapter binds to; concrete transports (LiveKit,
// Twilio) implement it in later, isolated steps behind this seam.
//
// Keep it small and honest: inbound audio frames, an outbound audio sink, a
// caller identity, and connect/disconnect lifecycle — nothing transport-
// specific leaks through. Inbound audio is delivered via a push callback (the
// shape VoiceSession.pushAudio consumes and the model every other Ethos adapter
// already uses), not an AsyncIterable.
