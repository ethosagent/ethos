// Inbound call hardening — the four gates a ringing phone passes before any
// provider socket is opened (voice V4, eng-review D12).
//
// A phone number is a cost surface with no login: every stranger who dials it
// can spend realtime-provider minutes, and an autodialer can spend them at
// machine speed. So the gates here are ordered CHEAPEST-REFUSAL-FIRST — budget,
// then rate limit, then concurrency, then allowlist — and a refusal never holds
// a resource, because a limiter that leaks a slot per refused call degrades to
// a denial of service after exactly `cap` refusals.
//
// Everything is pure with an injectable clock: no timers, no globals, no
// process-lifetime state beyond what the caller holds. That is what lets the
// app layer own the lifetime (one limiter per gateway, one budget per day) and
// lets a test drive a full hour or a day boundary in microseconds.

 * the moment a later check refuses, so a wall of refused calls leaves
 * `active()` at zero.
 *
 * `restricted: true` is the receptionist scope flag the dispatcher uses to run
 * the turn without owner memory or privileged tools. It is ALWAYS true (INB-001b):
 * the only identity a PSTN call carries is caller ID, which the calling party
 * sets and which is trivially spoofed, and no verification seam (spoken PIN,
 * pairing, STIR/SHAKEN attestation) exists on this path. So an allowlist match
 * does not grant owner identity: every caller is answered under the
 * unknown-caller policy — the receptionist when one is configured, otherwise
 * refused (`caller_unverified` for an allowlist match, `not_allowlisted` for
 * anyone else). LIMITATION: this means no inbound call reaches the bot's own
 * personality until a verification seam exists. Pinned by the 'INB-001b' cases
 * in `__tests__/inbound-gate.test.ts`.
 *
 * `prewarm` opens a provider socket on RING, which costs money on a call that
 * may still be screened, so the default `'allowlisted'` policy pre-warms only
 * for callers whose caller ID matches the allowlist (eng-review D12) — a cost
 * hint, which is all caller ID is good for.
