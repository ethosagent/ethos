// awaits — a goto, a click, a snapshot — so a takeover that begins one
// microtask after the check finds the agent still driving the page it has just
// handed to a human. Re-checking the flag at more call sites cannot fix that:
// a check-then-act with an await in between is a race by construction.
//
// So the flag keeps its job (ADMISSION: from the instant it is set, no new
// agent operation starts) and this lease takes the other one (MUTUAL
// EXCLUSION: an operation already running finishes, and the human is not handed
// the browser until it has). Ordinary tools hold the shared side for their
// WHOLE operation including cleanup; the takeover holds the exclusive side, and
// only gets it once the shared holders have drained.
//
// Why not `acquireProfileLock` / `acquireCreationLock`. Both are promise-chain
// mutexes — one holder at a time, waiters queue. Neither shape works here:
//   - Agent tools must not QUEUE behind a takeover. A tool that waits its turn
//     waits up to fifteen minutes for a human and then acts on a page that has
//     changed under it. It has to be refused immediately, which is a
//     non-blocking try-acquire, not a queue.
//   - The takeover needs to wait for N concurrent holders to finish
//     (`executeParallel` runs browser tools in parallel), not for one. A chain
//     of single holders cannot express "drain".
// A counter plus a drain signal is the smallest thing that does both, so that
// is what this is — kept in this file next to the two locks it sits beside.
//
// ORDERING (deadlock): the lease is always INNERMOST. Creation lock outside,
// profile lock inside it, lease inside both — a lease is only ever taken after
// `getOrCreateSession` has returned, and nothing that holds a lease goes on to
// acquire a creation or profile lock. There is therefore no cycle to close: a
// takeover draining leases never blocks a creation, and a creation never waits
// on a lease.

 * This is the dangerous half of the takeover story. Every caller of this

 * asynchronously in the middle of a navigation, and the navigation-failure
 * `catch` in `browse_url` / `browser_navigate`. A takeover that begins while a
 * navigation is in flight would otherwise have the browser destroyed under the
 * person using it by a handler that was scheduled before the lock existed —
 * "the browser cannot close underneath the human" broken by the agent's own
 * tidying up.
 *
 * TWO holders can be underneath, and both are checked here — the same pair
 * `sweepIdleSessions` checks, for the same reason:
 *
 *   `session.takeover`  — a HUMAN is driving. Set synchronously, so a lane
 *                         that opened before the lock is not the risk.
 *   `leaseHeldByOthers` — a SIBLING TOOL is driving: a click mid-navigation,
 *                         a screenshot mid-snapshot. `browse_url` failing does
 *                         not make `browser_click`'s page disposable, and the
 *                         two tools reach this function from opposite ends of
 *                         one session.
 *
 * `ownLease` is the caller's OWN lease, and passing it is what keeps this a
 * skip rather than a refusal to clean up after itself: cleanup runs inside the
 * lease on purpose (releasing first would let a takeover's exclusive lease land
 * mid-teardown), so without it every caller would recognise itself as the
 * sibling it must not close under. Omitting it fails safe — the session is left
 * for the idle sweeper, not closed under anyone.
 *
 * The check is here rather than at the call sites because the call sites cannot
 * know: the decision is made after they scheduled the call. Skipping is the
 * same trade `sweepIdleSessions` and `getOrCreateSession`'s policy-change
 * teardown already make — refusing to clean up beats closing a window someone
 * is typing into. The skipped session is not leaked: once the takeover clears
 * the flag and the last lease releases, the idle sweeper collects it on the
 * ordinary schedule.
 *
 * `closeAllSessions` / `cleanupOnExit` deliberately do NOT skip: the process is
 * going away, and the same abort that triggers them cancels the clarify the
 * takeover is parked on.
