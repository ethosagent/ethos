// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Durable delivery-obligation ledger
//
// The gateway's `MessageDedupCache` prevents DOUBLE sends. It records no
// durable obligation, so a crash between generating a reply and confirming
// platform delivery loses the turn silently — after the user already paid for
// the tokens. Dedup and durability are orthogonal; this is the durability half.
//
// Two-phase around every covered outbound send:
//   1. `record()` writes a `pending` row BEFORE the platform call.
//   2. `markDelivered()` flips it to `delivered` only once the adapter
//      CONFIRMED (`DeliveryResult.ok === true`).
//   3. On boot the gateway sweeps `pending` rows it owns and redelivers them.
//
// "Confirmed" deliberately does NOT mean "the promise resolved". Every real
// adapter catches platform failures and returns `{ ok: false }` rather than
// throwing, so a ledger keyed on "did not throw" would mark exactly the
// failures it exists to catch as delivered.
//
// At-least-once, not exactly-once: a reply that WAS delivered but crashed
// before the confirm write is sent again on the next sweep. That is the correct
// trade against silent loss.
