// The realtime session's tool host: ONE object that both advertises and
// services, so the two can never drift.
//
// A realtime session's tool list is spoken capability. When the provider is
// told it has a tool, the model will offer that capability out loud —
// "sure, let me look that up" — and a person on a phone will wait for it. A
// list that names something the server cannot service is therefore not a
// dropped request, it is a lie delivered in a friendly voice with no way for
// the listener to detect it. So the advertised list and the handled set are not
// two lists that agree; they are one list, derived once from the tool registry
// that is actually wired, and the mint and the control lane both build it from
// here (voice V1b, "advertised == handled").
//
// EVERYTHING dispatched here goes through the same `before_tool_call` hook the
// agent loop fires, carrying the same `voiceOrigin`. That is what keeps the
// approval surface — including A8's spoken-confirmation gate and its rule that
// a far-end caller's voice can never satisfy an owner confirmation — in force
// on a tool the realtime model called directly rather than through
// `agent_consult`.
