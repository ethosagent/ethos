// @ethosagent/tools-voice — the outbound telephony `call` tool
// (plan/phases/gap-voice-realtime.md §4 Phase C).
//
// `call` places an outbound PSTN call via the injected `SipTrunkClient`
// boundary (`@ethosagent/platform-voice`) and bridges it into a LiveKit room,
// where the existing VoiceChannelAdapter -> VoiceSession stack handles the
// conversation. The concrete SIP binding (`livekit-server-sdk` SIP API) is
// supplied at the app layer — this package binds ONLY to the interface, so it
// typechecks and unit-tests against a fake trunk.
//
// APPROVAL: the tool is marked `requiresApproval: true`. That flag is
// DECLARATIVE ONLY — AgentLoop emits a `tool_approval_required` event and then
// runs the tool regardless (packages/core/.../tool-processing.ts); nothing
// consumes the event today, so the flag on its own blocks nothing. The
// mechanism that actually prompts is the `before_tool_call` approval hook, whose
// danger predicate flags tools by name via `alwaysAsk`.
//
// `call` IS in `APPROVAL_SURFACE_ALWAYS_ASK`
// (packages/wiring/src/danger-predicate.ts), so on every surface that runs an
// approval flow a dial is flagged for approval regardless of approval mode.
// It is therefore also in `SPOKEN_CONFIRMATION_TOOLS`, which is derived from
// that set: a call REQUESTED out loud needs a verbal re-confirmation, and a
// far-end caller's voice can never satisfy one
// (packages/wiring/src/spoken-confirmation.ts). A surface with no approval hook
// wired — a bare library embedding — still has no gate; the flag alone is not
// one.
